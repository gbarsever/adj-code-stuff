<h3>Citation information</h3>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

The child in the case study, Amahl, is the son of an English father with
some derivations from “received pronunciations” and Indian mother who
speaks English only as a fourth language (following Hindi, Bengali,
Marathi). Amahl was born in Boston, Massachusetts 04-JUL-1967 and moved to the U.K.
at approximately one year of age, which may have influenced his late
speaking. The child lived with his paternal aunt from 19 months to 2
years, and started attending day nurseries and play groups in
Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire at 30 months.

<p>The data discussed were recorded in IPA transcriptions on index cards
from age 2;2.1 to age 3;9.14. 
Some tape recordings were made occasionally, however, most of the
description is based on non-recorded material. There were instances of
spontaneous speech, however the majority of the words were elicited with
phrases such as “can you say “zink” for me?”.

This corpus was retyped and adapted from the original diary study. A
significant portion of this work was undertaken by Tania Zamuner;
additional work was performed under an FCAR grant to Heather Goad. The
recording dates in the corpus correspond to the first date of Smith's
(1973) descriptive stages. Please note that the data have not been
entirely rechecked from Smith's original transcriptions. Careful
spot-checking however suggests that the conversion is accurate. Please
feel free to contact us in case you have questions or if you notice any
errors.
