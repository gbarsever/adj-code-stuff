<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This subdirectory contains the Reading corpus of transcripts from 72
British children ages 3, 5, and 7. The participants in the project were
Paul Fletcher, Michael Garman, Michael Johnson, Christina Schelleter,
and Louisette Stodel. The project was entitled “The standardization of
an expressive language assessment procedure” and was supported by
Medical Research Council grant no. 68306114N and NATO Collaborative
Research grant no. RG84/0135. The aims of this project were as follows:

<ol> <li>To establish a computer database of the expressive language of
British children between 3;0 and 7;0.

<li>To identify grammatical and lexical features of this database that
were developmentally significant.

<li>To apply this information in the identification, assessment, and
remediation of language-impaired children. This goal, which arises out
of earlier work on LARSP (Crystal, Fletcher, & Garman, 1989), affects
all aspects of the database including choice of interlocutor, data
collection methods, and transcription decisions. </ol>

<p><b>Elicitation</b>
<p>All data were collected in an interview situation between a female
adult and the child. This was a deliberate attempt to mimic the typical
initial encounter between a speech therapist and a child who is being
assessed. All interviews took place in a quiet area of the nursery or
school the child was attending, and lasted for approximately 45 minutes.
The elicitation protocol for these sessions included these techniques:

<ol>

<li>Stick-on game (SG). Conversation takes place around a game (supplied
by UNISET), consisting of a picture of either a house interior or a
farmyard, and an appropriate set of stickers to be located at various
points on these pictures.

<li>Free/guided conversation (FC). There are no props for this part of
the interview. The experimenter asks questions about the child’s school
and home experiences, and about significant past and future events in
the child’s life (Christmas, holidays, birthdays, Bonfire Night, and so
forth). The aim is to encourage the child to talk, in as spontaneous a
way as is possible within the constraints of the situation).

<li>Balloon story (BS). The balloon story is a brief picture story,
devised by Annette Karmiloff-Smith, to examine children’s pronominal
reference in discourse (Karmiloff-Smith, 1986).
</ol>

<p><b>Transcription and Segmentation</b>

<p>Conventions for transcription were the product of much discussion in
the project team; their formal implementation was the work of M. Johnson.
