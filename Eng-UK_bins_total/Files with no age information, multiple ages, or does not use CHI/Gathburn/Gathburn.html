<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>Cross-sectional data were collected from 12 Scottish children aged
3:0 to 6;4 at the Nursery of the Department of Psychology at the
University of Edinburgh. There are four children at each of three age
levels: 3-year-olds (mean age 3;2.15), 4-year-olds (mean age: 4;2),
5-year-olds (mean age: 5;0). Four Scottish adults interacted with the
children: two of the children’s teachers, one sevitor of the nursery,
and one mother of one of the children. The first three had educations
through secondary school; the last had attended college. Each group of
four Scottish children was videotaped in 8 half-hour sessions for a
total of 24 sessions. Each adult participated in two sessions with each
group. The structured sessions involved block tasks and art tasks. All
utterances were transcribed from the videotapes, along with extensive
information on the nonlinguistic contexts of the utterances. The data
were reformatted into CHAT by Rebecca Burns.
