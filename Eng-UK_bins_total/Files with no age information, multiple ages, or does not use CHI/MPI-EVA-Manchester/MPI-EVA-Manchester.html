<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p><b>ELEANOR</b> <p> Eleanor was recorded over a period of two years
(2;0.2 to 3;1.17).  During the early transcription of the data the
pseudo-name of Eleanor was used for anonymity reasons, therefore all the
files in the corpus have the extension of .EL.  More recently, however,
parental permission has been gained to submit the sound and video files
to CHILDES and for the child’s true name (Aliah) to remain in the files.
 We have therefore not engaged in the laborious task of removing the
name Aliah and changing it to Eleanor in the videos and the sound files.
 To avoid confusion please be aware that when listening to the video or
sound files you will hear the true name, Aliah, but the name may have
been changed to Eleanor within the transcript.

<p>In terms of content, the dataset is split into A recordings and B
recordings.  The A recordings consist of Aliah and her mother engaging
in naturalistic play with static-radio microphones picking up the
speech. The B recordings were captured using a wireless microphone
attached to a custom-made waistcoat.  During the B recordings Aliah
could wander around the house and engage with other family members.  The
mother was asked to not engage in the more intense naturalistic play
during the B recordings, but rather let any conversation or speech be
led by their child. There are only audio recording and no videos during
the B period.

<p>In terms of frequency, this large dataset is best considered in three
sections (Sections i, ii, iii).  Section i and Section iii comprise a
six-week intensive period.  During this intensive period, Aliah was
recorded for one hour/day five times a week.  For the A recordings, one
of these recordings each week is a video.  During period ii, Aliah was
recorded five times a week for one week every month.  Period ii is
therefore a less intense period.  Again, for the A recordings, one of
these recordings each week is a video.

<p>This data was originally transcribed using an early version of CLAN;
however the data has been completely updated to adhere to the 2013
transcription guidelines and to be compatible and pass CHECK in CLAN
2014.  The CHAT files have been linked to the audio files (WAV) and the
files annotated to match the 2014 MOR library.  The files have also been
processed through the 2014 CHATTER, MOR and POST programs.

<p><b>A summary of the frequency of data</b>

<p><b>Section i (Eleanor aged 2-00-01 to 2-01-10) The six-week intensive
period</b> <br> •	Eleanor is recorded for one hour, five times a
week, every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five
recordings is a video.

<p><b>Section ii (Eleanor aged 2-02-01 to 2-11-06)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	Eleanor is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there are five recordings one of which is a
video.

<p><b>Section iii (Eleanor aged 4-00-02 to 4-11-20) The six-week
intensive period </b> <br> •	Eleanor is recorded for one hour, one
week in every month. During this week there are five recordings one of
which is a video.

<p>A detailed inventory of the data and dates can be found in Appendix
1.

<p>Over the two year period the audio of a total of 194 sessions were
recorded using a standard Sony mini-disc recorder and Sennheiser
evolution radio microphones.  For the A recordings the microphones were
positioned around the downstairs of the house, allowing Eleanor to move
freely during his play whilst still capturing his speech.    For the B
recordings the radio microphone was stitched into a waistcoat unbeknown
to Eleanor.  This waistcoat recording allowed Eleanor to roam more
widely and engage with other family members.  For 21 of these recordings
a video recording was also gained using a standard video-camera.  These
videos are now in MPEG4 format and permission has been granted for these
to be submitted to CHILDES.  They are however password protected and
permission must be granted via Brian Macwhinney.

<p>All of the audio recordings took place in Eleanor’s home where she
was engaged in regular play activities with his mother.  In most of the
video recordings the investigator is also present and is engaged in play
with Eleanor.  The videos were also mainly recorded in Eleanor’s home,
although a number were recorded in the laboratory at the Max Planck
Child Study Centre at the University of Manchester.  The recordings are
60 minutes long, unless there was a problem with recording on that day.

<p>The data was transcribed over a number of years and by a number of
different transcribers.  However, the whole process was overseen by one
research investigator who ran regular reliability checks across the data
and across transcribers.  This same investigator also trained each of
the transcribers.  Although the data was originally transcribed using an
older version of CHAT, CLAN and MOR it has since been updated to adhere
to CLAN 2014 and the MOR LIBRARY 2014.

<p><b>FRASER</b> <p>This corpus contains the data from a longitudinal
naturalistic study of one child over a period of two years (2;0.0 to
3;1.11).  During the early transcription of the data the pseudo-name of
Fraser was used for anonymity reasons, therefore all the files in the
corpus have the extension of .FR.  More recently, however, parental
permission has been gained to submit the sound and video files to
CHILDES and for the child’s true name (Adam) to remain in the files.  We
have therefore not engaged in the laborious task of removing the name
Adam and changing it to Fraser in the videos and the sound files.  To
avoid confusion please be aware that when listening to the video or
sound files you will hear the true name, Adam, but the name may have
been changed to Fraser within the transcript.

<p>In terms of content, the dataset is split into A recordings and B
recordings.  The A recordings consist of Adam and his mother engaging in
naturalistic play with static-radio microphones picking up the speech.
The B recordings were captured using a wireless microphone attached to a
custom-made waistcoat.  During the B recordings Adam could wander around
the house and engage with other family members.  The mother was asked to
not engage in the more intense naturalistic play during the B
recordings, but rather let any conversation or speech be led by their
child. There are only audio recording and no videos during the B period.

<p>In terms of frequency, this large dataset is best considered in three
sections (Sections i, ii, iii).  Section i and Section iii comprise a
six-week intensive period.  During this intensive period, Adam was
recorded for one hour/day five times a week.  For the A recordings, one
of these recordings each week is a video.  During period ii, Adam was
recorded five times a week for one week every month.  Period ii is
therefore a less intense period.  Again, for the A recordings, one of
these recordings each week is a video.

<p>This data was originally transcribed using an early version of CLAN;
however the data has been completely updated to adhere to the 2013
transcription guidelines and to be compatible and pass CHECK in CLAN
2014.  The CHAT files have been linked to the audio files (WAV) and the
files annotated to match the 2014 MOR library.  The files have also been
processed through the 2014 CHATTER program.

<p><b>A summary of the frequency of data</b>

<p><b>Section i (Fraser aged 2-00-01 to 2-01-10) The six-week intensive
period</b> <br> •	Fraser is recorded for one hour, five times a week,
every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five recordings is
a video.

<p><b>Section ii (Fraser aged 2-02-01 to 2-11-06)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	Fraser is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there are five recordings one of which is a
video.

<p><b>Section iii (Fraser aged 4-00-02 to 4-11-20) The six-week
intensive period </b> <br> •	Fraser is recorded for one hour, one
week in every month. During this week there are five recordings one of
which is a video.

<p>A detailed inventory of the data and dates can be found in Appendix
1.

<p>Over the two year period the audio of a total of 216 sessions were
recorded using a standard Sony mini-disc recorder and Sennheiser
evolution radio microphones.  For the A recordings the microphones were
positioned around the downstairs of the house, allowing Fraser to move
freely during his play whilst still capturing his speech.    For the B
recordings the radio microphone was stitched into a waistcoat unbeknown
to Fraser.  This waistcoat recording allowed Fraser to roam more widely
and engage with other family members.  For 21 of these recordings a
video recording was also gained using a standard video-camera.  These
videos are now in MPEG4 format and permission has been granted for these
to be submitted to CHILDES.  They are however password protected and
permission must be granted via Brian Macwhinney.

<p>All of the audio recordings took place in Fraser’s home where he was
engaged in regular play activities with his mother.  In most of the
video recordings the investigator is also present and is engaged in play
with Fraser.  The videos were also mainly recorded in Fraser’s home,
although a number were recorded in the laboratory at the Max Planck
Child Study Centre at the University of Manchester.  The recordings are
60 minutes long, unless there was a problem with recording on that day.

<p>The data was transcribed over a number of years and by a number of
different transcribers.  However, the whole process was overseen by one
research investigator who ran regular reliability checks across the data
and across transcribers.  This same investigator also trained each of
the transcribers.  Although the data was originally transcribed using an
older version of CHAT, CLAN and MOR it has since been updated to adhere
to CLAN 2014 and the MOR LIBRARY 2014.

<p><b>HELEN </b>

<p>This corpus contains the data from a longitudinal naturalistic study
of one child over a period of just over two years (3;0.2 to 5;1.19). 
During the early transcription of the data the pseudo-name of Helen was
used for anonymity reasons, therefore all the files in the corpus have
the extension of .HE.  More recently, however, parental permission has
been gained to submit the sound and video files to CHILDES and for the
child’s true name (Hannah) to remain in the files.  We have therefore
not engaged in the laborious task of removing the name Hannah and
changing it to Helen in the videos and the sound files.  To avoid
confusion please be aware that when listening to the video or sound
files you will hear the true name, Hannah, but the name may have been
changed to Helen within the transcript.

<p>In terms of frequency, this dataset is best considered in five
sections (Sections i, ii, iii, iv, v).  Section i, iii and Section v
comprise a six-week intensive period at age 3;0.0 and 4;0.0 and 5;0.0
respectively.  During this intensive period, HANNAH was recorded for one
hour/day five times a week. During each week one of the recordings is a
video.  During period ii and period iv, HANNAH was recorded five times a
week for one week every month.  These periods are therefore less intense
and again if possible one of these recordings each week was a video.

<p>This data was originally transcribed using an early version of CLAN;
however the data has been completely updated to adhere to the 2013
transcription guidelines and to be compatible and pass CHECK in CLAN
2014.  The CHAT files have been linked to the audio files (WAV) and the
files annotated to match the 2014 MOR library.  The files have also been
processed through the 2014 CHATTER program, MOR and POST.

<p><b>A summary of the frequency of data</b>

<p><b>Section i (HELEN aged 3-00-01 to 3-01-11) The six-week intensive
period</b> <br> •	HELEN is recorded for one hour, five times a week,
every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five recordings is
a video.

<p><b>Section ii (HELEN aged 3-02-00 to 3-11-10)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	HELEN is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there are five recordings one of which is a
video.

<p><b>Section iii (HELEN aged 4-00-02 to 4-01-13) The six-week intensive
period </b> <br> •	HELEN is recorded for one hour, five times a week,
every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five recordings is
a video.

<p><b>Section iv (HELEN aged 4-02-01 to 4-11-07)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	HELEN is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there are five recordings one of which is a
video.

<p><b>Section v (HELEN aged 5-00-00 to 5-01-19) The six-week intensive
period  </b> <br> •	HELEN is recorded for one hour, five times a
week, every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five
recordings is a video.

<p>Over the two years and six weeks the audio of a total of 184 sessions
were recorded using a standard Sony mini-disc recorder and Sennheiser
evolution radio microphones.  For the recordings the microphones were
positioned around the downstairs of the house, allowing HELEN to move
freely during her play whilst still capturing her speech. For 34 of
these recordings a video recording was also gained using a standard
video-camera.  These videos are now in MPEG4 format and permission has
been granted for these to be submitted to CHILDES.  They are however
password protected and permission must be granted via Brian Macwhinney.

<p>All of the audio recordings took place in HELEN’s home where she was
engaged in regular play activities with her mother.  In most of the
video recordings the investigator is also present and is engaged in play
with HELEN.  The videos were also mainly recorded in HELEN’s home,
although a number were recorded in the laboratory at the Max Planck
Child Study Centre at the University of Manchester.  The recordings are
60 minutes long, unless there was a problem with recording on that day.

<p>The data was transcribed over a number of years and by a number of
different transcribers.  However, the whole process was overseen by one
research investigator who ran regular reliability checks across the data
and across transcribers.  This same investigator also trained each of
the transcribers.  Although the data was originally transcribed using an
older version of CHAT, CLAN and MOR it has since been updated to adhere
to CLAN 2014 and the MOR LIBRARY 2014.

<p><b>Note: Compound nouns</b> <p>We have used the Oxford English
Dictionary (OED) to help us make decisions around compound nouns. 
Generally, if a word is considered to be a single word in the OED, then
the word in this corpus will be a single word.  For example, the word
pushchair is a single word in the OED and will therefore appear in the
corpus as pushchair. In the OED if two words are hyphenated then they
will be joined with a + in the corpus.  For example, the word
<i>candy-floss</i> appears in the OED with a hyphen so will be coded as
<i>candy+floss</i> in the corpus.

<p><b>GINA</b>
<p>This corpus contains the data from a longitudinal naturalistic study
of one child over a period of just over two years (3;0.1 to 4;7.29). 
During the early transcription of the data the pseudo-name of Gina was
used for anonymity reasons, therefore all the files in the corpus have
the extension of .G.  More recently, however, parental permission has
been gained to submit the sound and video files to CHILDES and for the
child’s true name (Rubi) to remain in the files.  We have therefore not
engaged in the laborious task of removing the name Rubi and changing it
to Gina in the videos and the sound files.  To avoid confusion please be
aware that when listening to the video or sound files you will hear the
true name, Rubi, but the name may have been changed to Gina within the
transcript.

<p>In terms of frequency, this dataset is best considered in four
sections (Sections i, ii, iii, iv).  Section i and Section iii comprise
a six-week intensive period at age 3;0.0 and 4;0.0  During this
intensive period, RUBI was recorded for one hour/day five times a week.
During each week one of the recordings is a video.  During period ii and
period iv RUBI was recorded five times a week for one week every month. 
These periods are therefore less intense and if possible one of these
recordings each week was a video.  Unfortunately in period iv due to
family circumstances the dataset is fairly scant

<p>This data was originally transcribed using an early version of CLAN;
however the data has been completely updated to adhere to the 2013
transcription guidelines and to be compatible and pass CHECK in CLAN
2014.  The CHAT files have been linked to the audio files (WAV) and the
files annotated to match the 2014 MOR library.  The files have also been
processed through the 2014 CHATTER program, MOR and POST.

<p><b>A summary of the frequency of data</b>

<p><b>Section i (GINA aged 3-00-01 to 3-01-11) The six-week intensive
period </b> <br> •	GINA is recorded for one hour, five times a week,
every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five recordings is
a video.

<p><b>Section ii (GINA aged 3-02-00 to 3-11-06)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	GINA is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there are five recordings one of which is a
video.

<p><b>Section iii (GINA aged 4-00-02 to 4-01-11) The six-week intensive
period </b> <br> •	GINA is recorded for one hour, five times a week,
every week for the entire period.  One of each of the five recordings is
a video.

<p><b>Section iv (GINA aged 4-02-29 to 4-07-29)  The one week a month
period</b> <br> •	GINA is recorded for one hour, one week in every
month. During this week there should be five recordings and one video
but due to family circumstances it was difficult

<p>A detailed inventory of the data and dates can be found in Appendix
1. Over the two year period the audio of a total of 118 sessions were
recorded using a standard Sony mini-disc recorder and Sennheiser
evolution radio microphones.  For the recordings the microphones were
positioned around the downstairs of the house, allowing GINA to move
freely during her play whilst still capturing her speech. For 23 of
these recordings a video recording was also gained using a standard
video-camera.  These videos are now in MPEG4 format and permission has
been granted for these to be submitted to CHILDES.  They are however
password protected and permission must be granted via Brian Macwhinney.

<p>All of the audio recordings took place in GINA’s home where she was
engaged in regular play activities with her mother.  In most of the
video recordings the investigator is also present and is engaged in play
with GINA.  The videos were also mainly recorded in GINA’s home,
although a number were recorded in the laboratory at the Max Planck
Child Study Centre at the University of Manchester.  The recordings are
60 minutes long, unless there was a problem with recording on that day.

<p>The data was transcribed over a number of years and by a number of
different transcribers.  However, the whole process was overseen by one
research investigator who ran regular reliability checks across the data
and across transcribers.  This same investigator also trained each of
the transcribers.  Although the data was originally transcribed using an
older version of CHAT, CLAN and MOR it has since been updated to adhere
to CLAN 2014 and the MOR LIBRARY 2014.
