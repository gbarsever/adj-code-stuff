<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>Narrative study of British SLI young adolescents and a large
comparison group of typically developing peers. 19 adolescents with
specific language impairment (SLI) and 99 typically developing peers
(TD) were given two different types of narrative task: a story telling
condition and a conversational condition.

<p><i>Typically developing adolescents</i> <br>A large group of 99
typically developing adolescents (61 = female, 38 = male) were recruited
through two secondary schools in central England.  The adolescents had
no history of speech and language therapy or special needs educational
support as reported by school or parents.   English was their first and
only language.   The young people were recruited from 3 age groups: 13
yr olds, 14 yr olds and 15 yr olds.  Table 1 shows the mean age and
gender profiles.  A large group of comparison children was felt
necessary to provide age appropriate normative information on the tasks.

<p><i>Adolescents with Specific Language Impairment</i> <br>The group
consisted of 19 adolescents recruited from a wider study (Conti-Ramsden
et al., 1997, Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 1999, Conti-Ramsden et al.,
2001).  All adolescents had a classic SLI profile at least at one time
point in the study (i.e. Each child had a nonverbal IQ of ≥ 80 and
scores of at least one standard deviation below the normative mean on
one or more standard language assessment tests at either 7, 8 or
11-years-old).  However at the point of testing, 4 children had a
non-verbal IQ below this threshold.   The mean age and gender profile of
the group of adolescents with SLI can also be found in table 1.

<p>The current language profiles of the group were mixed, but the
majority still scored below 1SD on at least one part (i.e. expressive or
receptive) of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Functions (CELF 3;
Semel, Wiig, Secord, 1995). The main shift in profile since recruitment
was towards lower performance IQ scores. Eight of the 19 participants
with SLI had a lower than normal performance IQ (< 85) when assessed for
the present study at 14 years of age.  Of the 19 adolescents recruited
with a history of SLI, 9 adolescents still fitted the SLI profile. 
Information regarding educational placement was unavailable for 2
adolescents with a history of SLI however the remaining 17 all attended
mainstream schools at the time of the current study.  Of the 17
adolescents, 10 adolescents (58.8%) had some educational support within
the school environment (varying in degree from 1 hour a week to every
lesson).    The group profiles can be examined in table 2.

<p>There were two semi-structured naturalistic oral narrative tasks: a
story telling task and a spontaneous personal narrative. These tasks
were chosen because they were thought to well better represent the
everyday language skills of older children than some standardized
language measures.  Personal narratives form a large proportion of all
language (Beals and Snow, 2002) Whilst story-telling, may not be an
everyday activity, it is certainly evident in educational curriculums
and social communication.  Moreover, the ability to construct a cohesive
structured ‘story’ relates directly to the essay skills required of
adolescents in the UK school examination system. Formal standardized
tests are known to be less specific as children get older and often have
inadequate normative data for adolescent populations.  Both tasks have
previously been used with this age of participant and have yielded
interesting results (see below for details).  Furthermore, they
represent complementary paradigms in a number of ways: One has picture
prompts, while the other does not; one is based on a fictional scenario,
while the other is a real-life description; one encourages past tense
use, while the other is more likely to elicit present tense structures. 
In this way, the story task is likely to draw more heavily on working
memory resources as the participant mentally holds the story elements
together at the same time as constructing linguistically accurate
sentences.  The conversational task on the other hand, has less
externally guided structure, which may mean that individuals choose to
use less complex language or need more guidance from the researcher. 
The two tasks are described in detail below.

<h3>Story telling narrative task – Frog,  where are you? (Mayer,
1969)</h3>

<p>'Frog, where are you?' by Mercer Mayer is a wordless 24-picture
storybook telling the adventures of a boy and his dog who are in search
of their frog that has escaped from a jar in the boy's bedroom. It
provides an excellent prompt for looking at structural language ability.
 The ‘Frog Story’ as it has become known, has been widely used as a
narrative tool in the literature as it provides a series of events that
give structure to the narratives and can be used to provide a semantic
score as a measure of information included.  Data have been collected
using this task from typically developing children and adults
(Wigglesworth, 1997, Berman and Slobin, 1994, Reilly, 1992, Bamberg and
Damrad-Frye, 1991) and special developmental populations including
children with autism (Tager-Flusberg, 1995) and children with focal
brain injury (Reilly et al., 1998) as well as those with language
impairment (Norbury and Bishop, 2003, Reilly et al., 2003, Botting,
2001, Van der Lely, 1997).  In this study the protocol used by Van der
Lely (1997) was followed to collect the narratives (see figure 1a). 
Adolescents are asked to choose a story from an envelope so that the
researcher apparently doesn’t know which story has been picked.  This
encourages thorough and complete narratives with no ‘assumption of
knowledge’.  Note that while in this procedure adolescents were told
that there were 4 different but similar stories, in fact each envelope
contained the same ‘Frog Story’ as described above. This procedure was
used because following van der Lely (1997), it was thought to be an
appropriate protocol to encourage complete narratives from participants
in the adolescent age range.  It also meant that data collected would be
comparable in kind to previously reported studies.  The present study
also encouraged the adolescents to tell the narratives in the past
tense.  This was done in order to give the adolescents the opportunity
to use past tense forms, which have been reported in the literature to
cause specific difficulties for children with SLI (see Leonard, 1998 for
a review).  However, the Frog Story itself also lends itself to past
tense narration, since the participants are asked to ‘tell the story’
rather than describe what is happening.  Adolescents in this study had
no difficulty responding to the prompt to complete the task in past
tense.

<p>Story telling narrative protocol:
<ul>
<li>Before beginning the main task, a conversation with the participant was initiated by the investigator about something that happened to them yesterday or last week (“can you tell me about something you did yesterday/last week?”).
<li>All four envelopes were placed on the table. The investigator instructed the participant as follows: “Each of these envelopes contains a picture book that tells a story about something else that happened yesterday/last week.  The four stories are almost the same, but some things that happened are just a little bit different in each story. 
<li>The investigator then asked the participant to choose an envelope and look at it without showing the investigator.  (“Choose one of the envelopes and then take it over there away from me and have a good look at all the pictures in the book.  Then come back and tell me the story.  I have to guess which story it is.”)
<li>When the participant was ready they were invited back to the table where they could use a screen to hide the book from the experimenter. The investigator then instructed the participant:  “Now tell me the story of what happened yesterday / last week remember to tell me all the details so I will know exactly what happened and who did what, then I can guess which story you have.  I will get you started. Last week…”.
<li>The investigator listened as they told the story and signalled that she was following by nodding and encouraging.  She did not intervene unless the participant stopped narrating and then encouragement was given to carry on. If the participant was not looking at the book whilst narrating the story they were encouraged to do so.
</ul>
The participant was encouraged to tell the story in the past-tense thus if the participant started in the present tense, a prompt like “what happened then?” was used. If the participant continued in the present after two prompts, no further prompts were made.

<h3>Spontaneous narrative task, (Ingham, personal communication).</h3>
<p>This task was used to elicit conversational style spontaneous narratives and encourage the adolescents to use verbal 3rd person singular –s.  Agreement errors have also been widely reported for children with SLI (for example see Clahsen et al., 1997, Clahsen, 1999, Schütze and Wexler, 1996).  Figure 1b details the protocol for this narrative.  This narrative does not constitute a story in order to provide contrast with the story-telling task above.  However it does ask the participant to recount ‘actions’ which are sometimes felt to be a key definition of narrative. Furthermore, although this task was about ‘annoying features’ it did not result in list of attributes but rather personal narratives about another person. This type of verbal account is also felt to be more characteristic of everyday language for teenagers than story telling. 

<p>Spontaneous narrative protocol:
<ul>
<li>The investigator instructed the participant as follows: “Think of the most annoying person you know.”
<li>The investigator then asked the question: “Can you tell me some of the things this person does everyday that annoy you?”
<li>The investigator listened as they told the narrative and signalled that she was following by nodding and saying “uh-huh” or responding conversationally when necessary (“yes that would be annoying!”).  She only intervened if the participant stopped narrating and then encouragement was given to carry on and to speak for as long as they wished on this topic. 
<li>The participant was encouraged to use the verbal 3rd person singular –s thus if their response did not take this form, a prompt like “what other things does he/she do everyday that annoy you?“ was used.  However if the participant continued to use a different form after two prompts, no further prompts were made.
