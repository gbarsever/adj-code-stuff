<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This corpus consists of transcripts of audio recordings from a
longitudinal study of 12 English-speaking children between the ages of
approximately 2 and 3 years. The children were recruited through
newspaper advertisements and local nurseries. All the children were
first borns, monolingual and were cared for primarily by their mothers.
Although socioeconomic status was not taken into account with respect to
recruitment, the children were from predominantly middle-class families.
There were six boys and six girls, half from Manchester and half from
Nottingham. At the beginning of the study, the children ranged in age
from 1;8.22 to 2;0.25 with MLUs ranging between 1.06 to 2.27 in
morphemes. The children’s dates of birth and ages are available in the
headers to each transcript. The transcripts for each child are numbered
from 1 to 34 corresponding to the tape number and labeled (a) and (b) to
correspond to the two 30-minute sessions within each recording. The
following recording sessions were missed and therefore have no
corresponding transcript: Aran14a/b, Carl14b, Carl24a/b, John15a/b,
John16a/b, Ruth4a/b, Warren3b.

<p><b>Procedure</b>

<p>The children were audiotaped in their homes for an hour on two
separate occasions in every 3-week period for one year. They engaged in
normal play activities with their mothers. For the first 30 minutes of
each hour they played with their own toys whilst for the second 30
minutes, toys provided by the experimenter were available to the child.
For the duration of the recordings, the experimenter attempted as far as
possible to remain in the background to allow contextual notes to be
taken.

<p><b>Transcription</b>

<p>All speech was transcribed with the exception of speech not directed
to the child(i.e. speech between adults, telephone calls etc.). However,
if the child produced an utterance in response to such speech, the
relevant utterances were transcribed. Generally speaking, contextual
information was added only when the utterance would otherwise be
unclear. Of course, because the children were not videotaped, we had
only the experimenter’s notes for such information. Punctuation was kept
to a minimum – double commas indicate tag questions and single commas
were used to indicate vocatives.

<p><b>Phonological Forms</b>

<p>The data were collected with the intention of looking specifically at
early grammatical development. We were not interested in the specific
phonological forms the children used. Therefore, unless the child used
what appeared to be child-specific forms, the target word was
transcribed rather than an approximation of the child’s phonological
form. This also helped with coding using the MOR program.

<p><b>Postcodes</b>

<p>The children’s data were coded for imitation [+ I], self-repetition
[+ SR], partially intelligible utterances [+ PI], incomplete utterances
[+ IN] and routines [+ R]. The mothers’ data were coded for partially
intelligible utterances, incomplete utterances, and routines.

<p>Imitations were considered to be utterances where all components of
the child’s speech occurred in one of another speaker’s preceding five
utterances unless more than 10 seconds removed in time. This guideline
was adhered to even if the mother’s utterance encoded different
semantics or illocutionary force. If the child added anything to the
utterance (e.g., an extra word or morpheme), this was not coded as
imitation.

<p>Self-repetitions were considered to be utterances where all
components of the child’s speech occurred in one of his or her preceding
five utterances unless more than 10 seconds removed in time, even if the
two utterances in question functioned as independent communicative acts.
If the child added anything to the utterance this was not coded as
self-repetition. Incomplete utterances were those where the speaker
trailed off, was interrupted, self-interrupted, or completed an earlier
utterance.Partially intelligible utterances were those where a part of
the utterance was unintelligible and transcribed as xxx. Routines
included counting, nursery rhymes, the alphabet and so forth. However,
if the child added nonroutine material, as in “one two three bricks” the
utterance was not coded as a routine.

<p><b>Error Coding</b>
<p>The data were coded for the following errors (where ‘0’ indicates a missing speech component). For all of the errors the marker [*] was added to the main line and a dependent tier was added showing the correct form.
<table>
<tr><td>Missing morphemes<td><td><td><td>two dog-0s, he’s go-0ing
<tr><td>Case errors<td><td><td><td>her do it, me get it 
<tr><td>Missing auxiliaries<td><td><td><td>it 0is going there, I 0am getting a drink
<tr><td>Word Class Errors<td><td><td><td>a that one
<tr><td>Agreement errors<td><td><td><td>a bricks, does she likes it?, it don’t go there
<tr><td>Pronominal Errors<td><td><td><td>carry you (when the child wants to be carried)
<tr><td>Wrong word<td><td><td><td>I put it off (where the context indicates take is appropriate)
<tr><td>Overgeneralisations<td><td><td><td>it broked, I stayed it on there.
</table>
<p>Although we have attempted to be consistent in coding, errors may have been missed. In particular, missing auxiliaries and copulas have often not been coded. Where it was impossible to identify exactly what the error was, the error was simply marked on the main line with [*]. Anyone wishing to work on particular error types should carry out a detailed analysis of the child’s use of a particular system (e.g., pronoun case marking) rather than relying on pulling out errors by searching for the [*] error marker.
