<h3>Project Description</h3>

These data were contributed by Anne Van Kleeck of the University of
Texas at Austin. They are from 37 normal 3-year-olds in a laboratory
setting. The children are from the Aus-tin area and are native English
speakers. This sample was not controlled for race or socio-economic
status.

We have received only a small amount of information concerning the
files. Each individual file is headed with identifying information on
the child, the file names represent the childâ€™s name (usually first, but
last initial or name has been used where there is duplication of the
first name), and the session number. Each child participated in two
one-half hour ses-sions, creating the first file (Bree1) for the first
session and the second file (Bree2) for the second session. We hope to
eventually receive further details regarding the participants and data
collection procedures.
