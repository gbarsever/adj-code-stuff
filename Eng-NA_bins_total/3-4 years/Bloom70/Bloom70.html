<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This directory contains files from three children. The children are
Peter, Eric, and Gia. Peter was born on December 27, 1969; Eric was born
on July 2, 1964; and Gia was born on February 5, 1965. The files called
“bookeric” and “bookgia” have the material reported in the book. The
other files, beginning when Eric is 19 months old, have been entered
from handwritten transcripts. Eric and Gia were studied in the context
of the project reported upon in Bloom (1970). Additional data on
hand-written sheets are available for Eric and Gia, as well as for a
fourth child Kathryn.

<p>The Peter subdirectory contains 20 files, recorded between 1971 and
1973 when Peter was between 1;9 and 3;2. Peter was an upper-middle class
white child with college-educat-ed parents. He was a first-born child
living in a university community in New York City. Digitized audio is
available for most of the Peter files, but the following segments are
missing: Peter8-Tape21, Peter10-Tape25/26, Peter14-Tape37, and
Peter16-Tape43, Peter17-Tape45.
