<h3>Project Description</h3>

These files are derived from a larger corpus of written and spoken
transcripts collected by Donald Hayes and his students. This smaller set
of files is the segment of the database that deals specifically with
young children learning language. The files can be grouped into several
types:
<ol>
	<li>Haas. These tapes were recorded to study pitch changes in pitch in child's speech from 1;6 to 1;8.</li>
	<li>Horn. These are samples of speech from two working-class Black families with a three-year-old.</li>
	<li>LSNO. These are files from the Levin-Snow project studying parentâ€“child interaction in the hospital.</li>
	<li>MOM. These files track several working mothers with their children.</li>
	<li>Moore. These are dialogs between a male graduate student and his male child aged 1.6.</li>
	<li>Nurse. These files record nurses in the nursery rooms.</li>
	<li>Schacter. These three files, beginning with sch*, look at mothers from different social classes.</li>
	<li>Wooten. These files record a mother with her 4-year-old from Aberdeen, Scotland.</li>
</ol>
