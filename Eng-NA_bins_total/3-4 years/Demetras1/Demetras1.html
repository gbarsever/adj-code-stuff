<h3>Citation information</h3>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

This corpus contains 27 files of data collected by M. J. Demetras and
John Umbreit be-tween 1985 and 1987 from their son Trevor. Nine sets of
four 20-minute conversations be-tween Trevor and his father were
recorded over a period of 35 months for a total of 28 sessions. All but
one session were transcribed and included as part of this corpus. The
con-text was free play and the participants used a somewhat standard set
of toys through the duration of the recordings. Trevor was fairly
intelligible and verbal at this stage in devel-opment. He also
experienced two episodes of disfluency during this period, which was
partially captured in the data. Trevor was born on June 3, 1983.
