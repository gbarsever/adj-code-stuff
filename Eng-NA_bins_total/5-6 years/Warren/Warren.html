<p>In accordance with TalkBank rules, any use of data from this corpus 
must be accompanied by at least one of the above references.

This subdirectory contains data from 20 children interacting either with
their mothers or their fathers. The families are White and middle-class,
but nonprofessionals. One group of children was aged 1;6 to 3;1 and the
other group was aged 4;6 to 6;2. Ten of the children were in the “older”
group, (Mean age of 64.7 months, SD = 8.25, range from 4;6 to 6;2) and
ten are in a “younger” group (Mean age of 26.5 months, SD = 5.99, range
from 1;6 to 3;1). Half of the children in each age group were boys and
half were girls. Each child spoke to his or her mother and father in
successive dyadic, separate sessions. The order in which they spoke to
mother or father was randomized. The sessions took place in the child’s
home, normally in a living room or den area, with the child’s own toys
or books present to facilitate conversation. The experimenter was either
not present in the room (set up the tape recorder and left it behind) or
was in an isolated part of the room where the child could not easily see
her. 

<p>Parents were instructed to play with or talk to their children as
naturally as possible. They were instructed to bring out the child in
conversation, and the only limitation was that neither child or parent
was to actually read to the other. The parents were told that the
experimenter was interested in how language develops, and was tape
recording children of various ages for a project. Actually, the purpose
of the project was to examine the fundamental voice frequencies used by
mothers versus fathers when speaking to children, and the parents were
subsequently informed that the ex-perimenter was less interested in the
child’s speech than in their own. A Revox reel-to-reel recorder and
omnidirectional microphone were used and all home background noise was
eliminated. Each session with mother or father lasted at least 15
minutes, possibly up to half an hour. Thus, each child conversed for at
least half an hour. The recordings were transcribed verbatim by the
experimenter using the common English alphabet. Phonetic approximations
were used for any uninterpretable speech segments, and for common
“slang” phrases (e.g., “gonna,” “wanna,”“doin,” and “uh-huh”). Moreover,
care was taken to approximate dialectical variation in pronunciation.
All of the parents lived in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, but did not
have “Southern” accents. None of the parents or children had any obvious
speech disfluencies, and none of the children were language delayed.
The transcripts were compared for mother-directed speech.
