<h3>Project Description</h3>

The Home-School Study of Language and Literacy Development, which began
in 1987 was a collaborative, longitudinal research endeavor by
individuals from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Tufts
University, Clark University, and the Education Development Center in
Newton, Massachusetts. The primary investigators were Catherine E. Snow
and David K. Dickinson. The Research Coordinator was Patton Tabors. The
original purpose of the Home-School Study of Language and Literacy
Development was to investigate the social prerequisites to literacy
success, identifiable in both home and school interactions, of a group
of racially diverse, English-speaking children from low-income families
growing up in the Boston area. This group was selected for the study
because this population is at increased risk for difficulties with
literacy success. While data for this project are still being collected,
this directory contains only a subset of transcripts. In particular,
only transcripts collected in the home for children at ages 3, 4, and 5,
for the book reading, toy play, and child narratives (elicited report)
tasks are available. More information about these tasks and about the
participants of the study is presented below. Investigators interested
in obtaining materials from project that are not presented here are
encouraged to contact the PIs from the study. Two additional sets of
data, home visit 5 (children were in 2nd grade) and HV7 (children were
in 4th grade) are also included in the corpus.

<h4>Participants: </h4>
The initial number of participants was 83 American English speaking,
racially diverse, preschool age children from low-income families
growing up in or around Boston, Massachusetts. Seventy-four of these
children were still participating at age 5. The sample consists of 38
girls and 36 boys. Forty-seven children were Caucasian, 16 were African
American, six were of Hispanic origin, and five were biracial. (THIS IS
RELEVANT ONLY FOR HV1, HV3, & HV3.) By the time children were in 2nd
grade 68 children remained in the study. Of the 32 were boys and 36 were
girls, and there were 13 African American children, 44 children who were
Caucasian, 6 children who were of Hispanic origin and 5 children who
were biracial. (Number’s for 4th grade?) At the outset of the study 28
children were living in single-mother households, 40 were living in
two-adult households, and six children were living in homes with between
three and five adults. Eighteen children were the only children living
in the home, 30 had one sibling, 19 and two siblings, and seven children
had four or five siblings. Maternal education ranged from 6 years of
schooling to college enrollment. Thirty-five percent of mothers had not
completed high school, 37% had received only a high school diploma, and
28% had attended some post-high school education. At the first home
visit 40% of the families reported an income of less than $10,000, 11%
reported on income of $10-15,000, 19% reported an income of $15-20,000,
and 21% reported an income of over $25,000. At baseline, thirty-nine
percent of these families were receiving AFDC as their main income
source, 60% received income through employment (23% from primary
caretaker, 37% from spouse), and one family reported child support as
the main source of income. 

<h4>Procedure:</h4>
Children were visited once a year in their home from age 3 – 5 and then
again when they were in 2nd and 4th grade. Each visit lasted between one
and three hours. Home visits consisted of a number of different tasks
depending on the year. An outline of the different tasks for each visit
is presented below. Short descriptions of each task follow. In addition
to the tasks presented below, mothers were also interviewed about their
family circumstances on a yearly basis. Because of the sensitive nature
of the information contained in the maternal interview these transcripts
have not been included in the corpus.

<p>Book reading: Mothers and children read The Very Hungry Caterpillar at
all three visits, What Next, Baby Bear! During the second and third
visit, and Elephant on the third visit. The Very Hungry Caterpillar by
Eric Carle (1979) is a popular children’s book containing colorful
illustrations and simple wording. What Next, Baby Bear! by Jill Murphy
(1983) is a narrative about a young bear’s imaginary trip to the moon.
Animals in the Wild: Elephant by Mary Hoffman (reprinted in 1984) is a
nonfiction book containing factual information and color photographs of
different kinds of elephants. T

<p>Toy play: Mothers were instructed to play
with her child with a selection of toys brought by the investigators. At
the first home visit when children were 3 years old the toys included
painted blocks, small toy cars, a small tea set, spoons and saucers, a
school bus with little people, a toy baby bottle with disappearing milk,
a parrot puzzle, toy telephones, and an optiscope. The toys for the
second home visit included a different puzzle, dress-up hats and beads,
and firefighter hats. The toys for the third home visit included a
different puzzle and realistic toy animals. The play sessions lasted up
to 40 minutes but were on average 10-15 minutes in length. 

<p>Mealtime: At
the end of each home visit a blank audiotape was left behind for
families to record a typical mealtime interactions. Of the seventy-four
participants, 68 returned at least one mealtime recording. Mealtime
recordings from all three home visits were obtained for 36 families.
Sixty-four home visit one tapes were returned, 45 home visit two tapes
were returned, and 51 tapes from the third home visit were returned.

<p>Elicited report: Mothers were asked to encourage their children to tell
the investigator about some past experience. Letter writing: In this
task children were asked to write a letter to Eric Carle, the author of
The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
