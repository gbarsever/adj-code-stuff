<h3>Project Description</h3>

This directory contains a set of children’s conversational data
collected by Catherine Garvey and donated to the CHILDES in 1986. The
original corpus consists of 48 files of transcripts of dialogues between
two children with no experimenter or other children present. All of the
children’s names have been replaced with pseudonyms. The children range
in age from 2;10 to 5;7. In the original corpus, pairs of children
belong to 16 triads of three children. Particular files are always
dialogues between two members of each triad. Calling the children in a
given triad A, B, and C, there are always three possible pairings: AB,
AC, and BC. Data for triads 1, 3, 4, 6, 10, and 11 are not in the
CHILDES database. Thus, the database contains only 30 files from 10
triads. There is a file for each of these three pairings for each of the
10 triads.

The narrative section indicates when an interruption took place; it was
sometimes nec-essary for the observers to intervene, to bring in another
bag of toys, to turn on the light switch and caution the children not to
turn off the light, or to take one or both children to the bathroom.
Speech during these interruptions was not recorded. Conventional
orthogra-phy is used with a few exceptions such as “gonna,” “gotta,” and
“wanna.” Some clearly distorted pronunciations are indicated, such as
“beebe bottel” for “baby bottle.” When periods, commas, or question
marks appear in the text, they indicate utterance final intonation,
nonterminal intonation, and interrogatory illocutionary force,
respectively. In many scripts however, these punctuation marks are
missing, as there was an unfulfilled plan to add transcription for
intonation. The transcripts are heavily coded for actions, gestures,
proxemics, timing, and intonation. The timing marks are missing for
triad #4. Time is indicated in minutes and seconds with a colon
separating the minutes and the seconds.

The file “0stats.cdc” gives a variety of statistics computed for these
48 files by Catherine Garvey. These include total time, total words,
total utterances, rate of utterance, per-centage utterances in an
exchange, percentage time in focused interaction, and number of episodes
that are longer than nine exchanges. For each child in the pair, this
file reports number of words, number of utterances, and words per
utterance. A frequent code that occurs on the %com line is $CFA, which
stands for “common focus of attention.” The symbol $/= followed by a
number is used to indicate that some event or focus of attention
continues for a certain number of lines.
