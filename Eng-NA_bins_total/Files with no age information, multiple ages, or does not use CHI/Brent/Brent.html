<h3>Project Description</h3>

This corpus includes about 100 hours of recordings from English-speaking
mothers of preverbal children. All of the transcripts are completely
linked to the audio. Recordings and transcripts are available for 16
mother-child pairs. 8 of these were recruited without regard to the
education level of the mother but, as it turned out, all had at least a
bachelor's degree. Subsequently, 8 more mother-child pairs were
recruited with the requirement that the mother must not have completed
more than 2 years of college. The education levels of each of the
subjects can be viewed by clicking here. 6 of the 8 lower-education
subjects completed all or almost all of the sessions, but the remaining
2 provided only about 7 usable sessions each.

<p>Each mother-infant pair was recorded in their home during approximately
14 sessions lasting 1.5 to 2 hours each. Sessions were separated by
approximately 2 weeks during the period when the child was between 9 and
15 months old. The mother and child were left alone during the recording
session. The middle 75 minutes of each session were extracted,
digitized, and transcribed. Some details of the methods can be found in
our paper.
