<h3>Project Description</h3>

These transcripts are from 16 dyads of first-grade children at indoor
play. They were recorded by Mary Evans in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. The
transcripts were prepared from 10 minutes of interaction in about the
middle of each play session as specified on the tran-scripts. The
children in the dyads do not represent a random sample of children.
Rather, children with ID numbers under 43 were described by their
teachers as verbally quiet in kindergarten, whereas other children were
consistently verbal or became verbal across the kindergarten year.
During the interactions, children are often engaging in toy play where
they produce utterances for toys that they are manipulating. In these
cases, the files show these role-playing utterances as quoted sentences,
preceded by the +‚Äù code.
