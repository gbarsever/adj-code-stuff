@Situation:	This data was not transcribed by the individual who
	made the recordings. It may be transcribed in the future. However,
	since the data is from two decades ago, it is difficult for
	transcribers now to identify the correct speakers and any context
	for the utterances since it is only an audio recording. If this
	transcription does get completed in the future, please note that it
	may be an outlier if it is used for data purposes.
