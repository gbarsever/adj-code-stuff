<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p> Emily was born in February 14, 1980. This data set was collected
over a 15-month period (November 1981 to February 1983) when the child
Emily was 21 to 36 months old. The child’s parents recorded their
conversations and the child’s spontaneous speech while alone after they
left her room at night or at nap time. The recordings were done under
the direction of Katherine Nelson. A casette recorder was placed under
Emily’s crib. Tape recordings were made more frequently in the first few
months. Tapes were reviewed and commented upon by the child’s mother,
and were initially transcribed by both the mother and the researcher.
Different researchers reviewed the tapes over a 2-year period. The final
transcription made available to CHILDES has revised some of the original
versions for consistency and accuracy. The data have been reported in a
number of previous publications, and the study is documented more fully
in Nelson (1989). There may be minor discrepancies in the version
delivered to CHILDES compared with published excerpts. Such
discrepancies are to be expected given the difficulties of interpreting
speech of a child talking to herself at this age. The tapes contain many
references to individuals in addition to parents and child, including
baby-sitter (Tanta), grandmother (Mormor); baby brother (Stephen), and
friend Carl. The names of other friends and relations have been changed
for confidentiality, and are not necessarily consistent with the names
used in previous publications (which were also substitutes). Last names
have been consistently deleted, although in some cases this interrupts
the rhythmic quality of the talk. Permission to use the data for
research must be obtained before publication is contemplated.
