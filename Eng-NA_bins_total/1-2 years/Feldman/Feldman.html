<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p[>The data in this study come from a longitudinal study of Andrea
Feldmanâ€™s first child, code-named Steven, from age 0;5 to 2;9. Steven
was born 18-JUL-1992. Feldman began video and audio-taping Steven once a
month from 0;5 to 1;2, after which she taped him approximately three
hours per week. Phonetic transcriptions of Steven's speech are included
only on words that differ noticeably from the adult standard; all other
words are written on the main tier in standard English. At the time of
taping, the mother was a linguistics doctoral student and the father was
a senior instructor in Writing at the University of Colorado.

<p>Steven was tested cognitively at two and three years old by his
pediatrician. On the Verbal Language Development Exam he scored 3.88
(approximate developmental age) at two years old and 5.74 at three years
old. On the Denver Articulation Screening Exam, he scored in the 98th
percentile at age three; for purposes of comparison with other children,
one would classify him as a rapid language learner.

<p>The data were collected using a Sony FE camcorder along with a Marantz
tape recorder and a Tecnica remote microphone. A heavy duty Bogen 3211
tripod was also used at times. Steven was always taped in our own home,
with one or both parents present. Usually, one parent operated the video
camera while the other interacted with the child. 'Laura', Steven's
younger sister, was born when he was 1;11.13; she is present and
sometimes making sounds (but not yet speaking) on some of these tapes.

<p>Ten one-hour tapes between the ages of 1;2.1 and 1;4.16, and fourteen
between the ages of 1;11 and 2;3.26 were transcribed. Steven's Lexicon
(note: parents were relaxed about using some of STV's child forms to
him, and sometimes with each other)
