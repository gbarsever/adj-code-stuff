<h3>Project Description</h3>

This study examined children from families living in Suwannee County,
Florida. This area was chosen because it fits the criterion of being a
rural, Southern community that has a predominantly white, working-class
population. It is also the family home of this inves-tigator’s parents
and numerous aunts, uncles, and cousins. Through work on the qualifying
paper, contacts had already been established at the Suwannee County
Health Department to obtain access to the immunization records. In
addition, the investigator’s shared regional accent and shared cultural
experiences allowed easy access to and ready acceptance by the study
families.

<h4>Participants</h4>
The participants were three girls and their families. Two of the girls
were approximately 19 months of age at the time of selection and the
third was 22 months. One participant was the second-born, one was the
third-born, and the third participant was the fourth-born child in the
family. The next-oldest sibling in each family was approximately 18
months older than the third- and fourth-born participants and the older
sibling was 2 years older than the second-born participant. All of the
participants were the products of normal pregnancies, were healthy at
the time of taping and had no apparent hearing, speech or mental
deficiencies. They were located through immunization records obtained
from the Suwannee County Health Department and the records of a
pediatrician in Live Oak. The mothers were contacted by telephone and a
meeting arranged to ascertain if the family met the criteria for the
study.

<h4>Recruitment</h4>
At the initial meeting the mothers were told that the investigator was
interested in ob-serving how children change or develop over time.
Because the families were selected ac-cording to the age of the younger
child, the younger child was called the target child. It was emphasized,
however, that we were interested in how both children developed over
time, not just the younger one. It was explained to the families that
they were entering a long-term commitment to the study. It was agreed
that the sum of $100.00 would be paid to the families as an incentive to
complete the study. Fifty dollars was paid to each family at the end of
the first taping session and the remaining $50.00 was paid at the end of
the final tap-ing session. In addition, at the end of the fifth taping
session, the investigator took the fam-ilies out to lunch. The mothers
also signed a consent form. The mothers were interviewed periodically
and asked their views on child rearing, how their children spend the
day, meth-ods of discipline, goals for their children, and other related
issues. They were asked more specific questions on how they thought
their children learn language, how the parents affect their children’s
language learning, how important language learning is, how they thought
their children will do in school, what they thought their children
should be able to do by the time they enter kindergarten, and what they
perceived as the long-term and short-term ef-fects of their children’s
education. In addition, the mothers were asked how they felt about their
children watching television and if it should be regulated or not. In
the ethnographic tradition, detailed descriptions of the community and
the children and their families are provided. The descriptions help the
reader understand the environment in which these chil-dren are learning
language. The purpose of these portraits is to add a richness and
completeness to the data.

<h4>Data Collection</h4>
Within one week of the initial meeting a taping session was conducted in
each partici-pant’s home. Taping was accomplished with a Sony™ Video 8
AF portable videocassette recorder. Prior to the taping the recording
equipment was brought into the participants’ homes to allow the children
to examine the equipment to lessen the disruptive influence on the
normal interaction. Occasionally, during the taping sessions, one of the
children would come over to examine the camera, but generally, the
camera was ignored once the toys were introduced. Each taping session
lasted approximately 60 minutes. A toy bag provided by the investigator
was introduced at the beginning of the session and the family played
with whatever interested them. The toys were appropriate for the ages of
the children and includ-ed such items as books, blocks, action figures,
puzzles, pull-toys, and one playset. New toys and books were added over
the taping sessions to maintain interest. Occasionally the participants
would bring out a favorite toy or book of their own. Taping sessions
were scheduled at times which the mothers deemed most convenient and
most likely to have the children in a receptive mood. Taping took place
approximately every four weeks. Because of illness or vacations,
occasionally the sessions were scheduled a little farther apart. A
total of 10 sessions was recorded for each family. Thus the language
development of these three children was followed over a period of about
9 months during the latter part of their second year and the early part
of their third year. This age was chosen because during this time the
child’s language is expanding greatly in complexity of syntax and size
of vocabulary. The investigator was present for all of the tapings and
made contextual notes to aid in transcription. The presence of an
outsider and recording equipment no doubt affects the in-teraction among
the family members. For this reason one “practice” taping session was
made with each family, the data from which was not included in later
analyses. It was ob-served that with repeated exposure to the taping
situation the disruptive effects of the data collection methods were
minimal.

<h4>Data Coding</h4>
Transcripts of the tapes were made as soon as possible after the session
by the investi-gator. The data was transcribed in CHAT. In determining
how to divide up maternal utter-ances, it was decided to use breath
groups. That is, what the mother said on one breath was considered to be
one utterance. One of the mothers tended to have longer utterances than
the other two. On occasion, this mother (Darla) might take a quick
supplemental breath, but the pause would be less than one second and it
was clear that she was continuing the same utterance. The feedback data
were obtained using the modified coding scheme described in Demetras,
Post, and Snow (1986).
