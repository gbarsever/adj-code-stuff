Acoustical cues and grammatical units in speech to two preverbal
infants. Journal of Child Language, 35, 869-902.

<p>Dr. Soderstrom requests that she be sent a copy of any peer-reviewed publications involving analyses of this database. 

<p>In accordance with TalkBank rules, any use of data from this corpus must be accompanied by at least one of the above references.

<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This corpus was collected to examine the properties of speech input
available to preverbal infants relevant to the acquisition of the
grammar, and to evaluate the prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis for
preverbal infants. The collection of this corpus was funded by a
Kirschstein NRSA postdoctoral research fellowship 5F32HD042927 to MS and
an NIH grant 1RO1HD32005 to JLM.

<p>The participants were two mothers, each with young boy babies. The
mothers and their babies were visited at (semi)-regular intervals from
6-10 months (14 hours and 8.5 hours), along with two one-hour recordings
each at 12 months. Transcripts or analyses of two follow-up recordings
made of each mother at 18 months (with video), may be made available to
individuals upon request to the above address. Additional information
regarding the two families is available in the JCL citation below.

<p>The mothers very kindly agreed to donate their recordings to CHILDES and
to have the first names of the immediate family members available in
CHILDES in order to facilitate analyses. Please treat this information
with respect and help to preserve their anonymity otherwise. Last and
middle names and some other possibly identifying information have been
removed from the transcript and recordings.

<p>Charles was born 24-FEB-2003 and his brother on 29-AUG-1998.  Joseph was
born 19-DEC-2002.  His sister was born 17-MAR-2000 and his brother on
07-APR-1998.

<p>The audio recordings were collected by the mothers in the home. 
Recordings obtained within a short period of time are combined into the
same transcript file.  Transcription uses basic CHAT format with no
phonetic detail.  Please note that while care was taken in transcribing
speech errors, noisy environments, and other difficult sections, the
transcripts should not be considered error-free. Users should examine
the transcripts and/or recordings carefully given their particular
research needs. Additional information regarding the transcription
process is available in the above JCL reference or by contacting Melanie
Soderstrom at the above address. Please advise Melanie Soderstrom if you
detect any obvious discrepancies between the recordings and the written
form.
