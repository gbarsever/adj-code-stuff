<h3>Project Description</h3>

<h4>Participants</h4>
The transcripts presented were part of a prospective longitudinal study.
 Participants were recruited by mail as part of the University of Texas
at Dallas Language and Communication Database Project. Only full-term
(38–42 weeks gestation) monolingual, normal birth-weight children (at
least 2500 g), who did not experience extensive medical complications at
birth, other major illnesses, hospitalizations, or developmental
disabilities, were included. The participants were all from
well-educated families. Years of maternal education ranged from 12 to 20
with a mean of 16.5 years and a standard deviation 1.91 years. All
children were learning English as their first language, and none of the
parents reported that their child experienced substantive exposure to
another language (i.e., more than 7 hr per week). All participants were
brought into the lab within 1 week of their 6, 9, 12, 18, 22, and
30-month birthdays, where they were engaged in a parent–child
interaction. In addition, parents completed a commercially available
parental report instrument, the MacArthur CDI: Words & Gestures (CDI
W&G; Fenson et al., 1993).

<h4>Data collection and procedures for laboratory visits</h4>
All videotapes were collected in a child friendly laboratory at UTD.
Laboratory visits were held in a child-friendly observation room with
two-way mirrors on the front and back walls. Parent–child dyads sat
facing each other and engaged in spontaneous play interactions using a
standard set of age-appropriate toys. Parents were instructed to play
with their child as they would typically. At 9 months the infants were
seated in an infant seat with a tray where toys could be placed, and at
12 and 30 months they were seated on the floor. For all sessions,
split-screen images were videotaped for later data reduction and
analyses.

<h4>Transcription</h4>
For each mother–infant dyad, 10 min of toy-mediated play was transcribed
onto computer files and formatted in accordance with the CHAT
transcription conventions of the CHILDES system (MacWhinney, 1991).
Transcripts were verified by a second transcriber for content and
checked for adherence to transcription conventions using the automatic
checking facilities of the CHILDES system. Utterance boundaries were
based primarily on intonation contour and, secondarily, on pause
duration. No attempt was made to distinguish the number of
unintelligible words in a string. Discrepancies in the transcription
were resolved by consensus.

<h4>Coding</h4>
The transcripts are coded using The Inventory of Communicative
Acts—Abridged (INCA-A; Ninio, Snow, Pan, & Rollins, 1994). A description
of these codes may be found in the speech act section of the CHAT
manual. The INCA-A is a shortened and modified version of the system
developed by Ninio and Wheeler (1984; see also Ninio & Snow, 1996). The
system is based both on speech act theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1976)
and studies of face to face interaction (Goffman 1974; Streeck, 1980)
that emphasize the importance of socially constructed communicative
interchanges. Thus, the system identifies and codes communicative intent
at two different levels, the level of the social interchange and the
level of the utterance, thus acknowledging the existence of an
organization of talk at a level higher than the single utterance (c.f.
Dore & McDermott, 1982; Streeck, 1980). An interchange is defined as one
or more rounds of talk, all of which serve a unitary interactive
function implicitly agreed upon by the interlocutors. Within this social
interchange, speakers express specific intents at the utterance level.
The INCA-A, then, actually consists of two subsystems, each of which
codes for a different component of communicative intent. Because the
system was designed to provide exhaustive coding of the communicative
attempts expressed by children of varying ages (as well as their
mothers), it can reflect development and continuity across a wide age
range.
