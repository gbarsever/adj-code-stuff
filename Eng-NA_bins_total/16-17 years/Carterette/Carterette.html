<h3>Project Description</h3>

This subdirectory contains the full text of the speech corpus in
Carterette and Jones (1974) donated to the CHILDES by Edward Carterette
of the University of California at Los Angeles in 1985. The data were
taken from a computer tape from which the book had been made. The
characters on that tape were translated first into ASCII and then into
UN-IBET. The book is composed of a standard orthographic transcription
of conversations and the corresponding text in phonetic orthography on
the facing page.

<h3>Participants</h3>
The data were collected from first-, third- and fifth-grade students as
well as adults. The adult sample was similar to the child samples in
community, national and regional origin, and socioeconomic status. It
was obtained from junior college classes of a city college in
California. There were 54 first graders, 48 third graders, 48 fifth
graders, and 24 adults. First graders did more giggling, interrupting,
and drowning each other out, so more partic-ipants were needed to
provide a comparable amount of material.

<p>Children from two different schools were used to reduce possible biases
of unsuspected sorts. Both schools had children drawn largely from the
middle socioeconomic level. The investigation of the effect of
socioeconomic status on language development is an important one, but
not the subject under investigation here. Moreover, it also requires a
norm. It was just this norm for studies of language development of all
sorts that this database provides. The sample used all children in a
grade who were present when called and who were not excused by reason of
foreign language background, marked non-California dialect, or speech
impediments. Because regions of the country differ in the phonemes used
in speech, it was judged more in keeping with the aims of the study to
include only one type of regional speech, which happened to be Southern
Californian.

<h3>Data Collection Situation</h3>
A simple social situation was used. Three children were seated around a
small table with a young, friendly adult. The adult greeted the children
by name, told them she wanted to find out what children in their grade
were interested in, and asked them to talk to each other about anything
they wanted to talk about. Some groups required somewhat more
en-couragement; if so, the adult asked a question or two: “What do you
do after school?” or “How many in your family?” Thereafter she said
nothing. After the initial warm-up period, which was discarded for the
transcription, the speech appeared to be children’s normal speech. It
was rapid; there were interruptions; it covered every conceivable topic;
it was full of slang and noise words; there was give-and-take. This,
then, was the situation in which all the child speech samples were
recorded.

<p>For the adults, the situation was structured differently. The
participants were from ele-mentary psychology classes, so their
knowledge of psychological jargon was flattered. They were told that the
experiment was investigating small group processes and that the
situation was to be completely nondirective. Then they were introduced
by first names and told they were at a party. The experimenter excused
himself (psychologically) to get the snacks. Again groups of three were
always used. Most of the adults did not know each other, whereas the
children did. The three-person interaction proved as useful for adults
as for children, and the language produced was judged to be normal,
everyday conversation, as rapid, slangy, and diverse as any in an
unrecorded situation.

<p>As many individuals and as many groups as possible were included, in
order to reduce the effect of idiosyncrasies of vocabulary, topic,
sentence constructions, pronunciation, and various aspects peculiar to
spoken language. However, it was also important to allow suf-ficient
time for each group to warm up and then become thoroughly engrossed in
conver-sation, for otherwise many aspects of oral language suffer.

<p>Jones and Carterette (1963) showed that at least 6,000 words are
necessary for stable statistical results, so the goal for the size of
each sample was set at 10,000 words per level. It was felt that more
than this would require too much time for phonemic transcription, which
is very slow. Well over 10,000 words per level were actually
transcribed, but more material than that was collected and remains
untranscribed.

<h3>Transcription</h3>
Each tape was first transcribed by a typist, listening with binaural
earphones. The instructions were to include all consecutive material,
but if some part was incomprehensible to omit the entire utterance.
Similarly, if some person was interrupted and did not pick up the thread
of the utterance, the whole utterance was to be omitted, but if he or
she did re-sume, then the interruption was to be omitted. The second
step was to have the letter tran-scriptions checked by a research
assistant. Next the phoneticians took over. Two formal reliability
checks were made. The %pho lines are missing from the last 15% of the
adult.cha file. These are in the book and will have to be reentered
eventually by hand.
