This CHILDES archive file contains caregiver-child interaction data from
six children who participated in the Fredonia Child Language Project
directed by Richard M. Weist and supported by National Science
Foundation grant # BCS-0091702 and by the State University of New York
at Fredonia.  The goal of this longitudinal project was to obtain
caregiver-child interaction data from children aged 2 to 5, in order to
capture the children’s language in an early phase of the acquisition of
their initial system of temporal reference (i.e., their Event Time
system) and continue observations through the emergence of their
advanced system of temporal reference (i.e., their Reference Time
system).  Whenever possible, the children were audio tape recorded in
either a laboratory setting or in their homes twice a month for
approximately 30 minutes.  The audio tapes were transcribed into the
CHAT format (MacWhinney, 2000), and then the transcriptions were
completely checked for accuracy.  The children are as follows together
with their birthdates, starting ages, ending ages, and number (n) of
transcripts: Ben (04-JUN-1999, 2;4 – 3;3 n = 11),  Emily (03-JAN-2001,
2;6 – 4;5 n = 23), Emma (17-JUL-1999, 2;7 – 4;7 n = 28), Jillian
(11-MAY-1999, 2;1 – 2;10 n = 22), Matty (09-JUN-1999, 2;3 – 5;0 n = 56),
and Roman (12-DEC-1998, 2;2 – 4;7 n = 42).  The families of two of the
children, Ben and Jillian, moved away from Western New York prematurely
during the projected span of the project.  All of the children in the
Fredonia Child Language Project were residents of Chautauqua County in
Western New York State, they came from middle class homes, and their
parents were professionals.

<p>The data from five of the six children together with the data from five
children that were already available in the CHILDES archives [Abe 2;4 –
4;11 (Kuczaj, 1976), Adam 2;3 – 4;10 (Brown, 1973), Naomi 1;2 – 4;9
(Sachs, 1983), Nina 1;11 – 3;3 (Suppes, 1974), and Sarah 2;3 – 4;11
(Brown, 1973)] formed the basis for a study of the relationship between
the emergence of the morpho-syntax of the temporal systems and the
expression of autobiographical memories.  The interested reader can
learn more about these children and how their data relate to existing
CHILDES data in Weist and Zevenbergen (2008).  Furthermore, the data
from one of the children in the Fredonia Project were included in a
cross-linguistic (i.e., English – Polish) study of the emergence of
finite morphology in Weist, Pawlak, and Hoffman (in press).
