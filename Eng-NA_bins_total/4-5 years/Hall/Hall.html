<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This directory contains a large database of conversational interactions
from 39 children aged 4;6 to 5;0. The files were computerized by Bill
Hall of the University of Maryland and donated to the CHILDES in 1984.
They were first placed into CHAT format in 1987, but this work was
redone from the originals in 1991 to clear up additional problems.
Although the conversion to CHAT was generally straightforward, it was
not possible to code overlaps by pairs. Instead, the overlap marked was
coded by using the [%^] sign for without any attempt to indicate the
matches between overlap markers.

<p>The corpus was collected with the purpose of providing a solid basis for
comparing vo-cabulary usage in different socioeconomic and ethnic
groups. This section describes how the corpus was collected in a way to
ensure that spontaneous speech would be recorded in a variety of natural
situations. These situations are characterized in as much detail as
possible, to provide users of these data with an accurate picture of
the conditions under which they were collected.

<p>Participants were 39 preschool children (4;6 to 5;0) divided
approximately equally ac-cording to race and socioeconomic status (SES)
as follows: middle-class Black, middle-class White, working-class Black,
and working-class White. The working-class children in our sample were
attending federally-funded preschools: the middle-class children were in
private preschools. The working-class Black children were in all-Black
classes, with Black teachers, whereas the middle-class Black children
were in interracial classes with both Black and White teachers. None of
the Black target children were in the same classes as any of the White
target children in our sample.

<p>Language samples were collected over 2 consecutive days for each child.
On each day, an average of about 150 minutes of conversation were
recorded, distributed among differ-ent situations. Most importantly, the
situations in which the data were gathered were both natural and varied.
Conversations were taped in a variety of situations at home, at school,
and en route between the two. The children and their families were aware
that they were being taped, but this seems to have caused little if any
disruptions of normal activities. There are occasional references
(although relatively few) to the fact that the tape recorder is on; but
the conversations are natural. Reading the transcripts, one can clearly
sense that the families are not “putting on an act” for the tape
recorder; they tend to ignore it almost completely. Even if the presence
of the tape recorder does exert some effect, the fact re-mains that
there is no other method, apart from deception, that would offer a less
obtrusive way of obtaining natural data.

<p>The taping equipment was also chosen to minimize any disruption of
normal conversa-tion or activities. The children wore vests with
wireless microphones sewn in; their move-ments were not restricted, and
they seemed quickly to forget about having them on. The use of wireless
microphones made possible the inclusion of speech by the target children
that might not otherwise have been recorded, including monologues spoken
while the child was out of the hearing of any visible listener. Field
workers clipped microphones to their ties. Although other adults and
nontarget children in the study did not wear microphones, the two
microphones used were, in general, sensitive enough to pick up
significant verbal in-teraction with the children in the study. Portable
tape recorders enabled data collection in a number of different
settings, for example, in homes, shops, moving cars, and on sidewalks.
The mobility achieved in this way would not have been possible with
videotapes; although videotapes would provide more complete data in some
respects, their use would have been far more disruptive.

<p>The effects of the experimenter’s race were minimized by using a Black
field worker with Black families and a White field worker with White
families. In the collection of data, the field workers tried to be as
unobtrusive as possible. They rarely initiated conversations, but if
spoken to, attempted to respond naturally. One of the field worker’s
responsibilities was to provide a verbal description of the context. For
the purposes of this research, the context included: where the recording
took place, where the participant was, who the inter-actants were and
what they were doing. Descriptions of context often included what
hap-pened prior and subsequent to, as well as simultaneous with, the
verbal interaction.

<p>In order to sample situational variations in language, each child was
recorded in a series of 10 temporal situations, which can be grouped
into three basic categories: Home, School, and Transition. The Home data
consists of tapes made in the following situations: prior to school in
the morning, arriving home from school, before dinner, during dinner,
and before bed. Each of these took place in or near the child’s home,
and includes approximately 30 minutes of conversation (15 minutes on
each of the days taping was done). Particular seg-ments of activities
are missing from particular files. In BOO, the dinner segment was taped
outside on the street. In TOS there is no dinner segment. In JAF and ANC
there are no di-rected-activity segments. The target children were
between 4;6 and 5;0 during the taping. In each of the four groups, there
were more male than female target children. The makeup of the families
differs somewhat from one group to another. The social class and ethnic
status of the children is as follows. Asterisks mark children for whom
we have audio data, but no transcript.

<p>Participants GRC, LEA, and GAS in the White Professional group have
taperecordings, but no transcripts yet. A speaker is considered present
if there are more than 100 words spoken at home by speaker or speakers
in that category. For example, there was a brother of the target child
present in 5 of the 11 Black middle-class families in our sample, that
is, in 45% of these families, but only in 3 (that is 33%) of the White
working-class families. In all the families in our sample, both the
experimenter and the target child spoke more than 100 words at home.

<p>The make-up of the conversations at home was also investigated by doing
race x SES ANOVAs on the percentage of the total conversation spoken by
each category of speaker.

<p>There were no main effects or interactions of race or SES in the
percentage of the con-versation spoken by the target children. Thus, in
all the groups in the study, the target chil-dren had a roughly
equivalent share of the conversation. An analysis on the absolute number
of turns spoken by the target children also showed no main effects of
race or SES.

<p>The experimenter took a significantly larger proportion of turns with
black families, and with lower SES families. Conversely, black mother,
and working-class mothers, took a smaller proportion of turns. These two
facts are presumably related; the fact that the ex-perimenter takes a
larger proportion of turns in a given group means that some other
speak-ers must necessarily get a smaller share. It is interesting to
note that increased talk by the experimenter encroaches not on the
speech of the target children, but on that of the parents. The reason
for the experimenter taking more turns in the tapes of the black
families is clear: The black families almost without exception invited
the experimenter to eat dinner with them. The experimenter working with
the white families, on the other hand, was only occasionally invited for
dinner, and was able to consistently decline. It is not clear, however,
why the experimenter would take a larger proportion of turns with the
working-class families than with the middle-class families, especially
since each of the two experimenters worked both with the working-class
and middle-class families. The only other significant difference is that
there was a higher percentage of unrelated children present in the
working-class families than in the middle-class families. (The effect is
significant for all unrelated children, and for male unrelated children,
but not for female unrelated children. The school data includes
conversations taped during the following situations: Arriving at school,
snack time, free play, and teacher-directed activity. “Arriving at
school” picks up where the Transition situation leaves off, that is, at
the point where the target child enters the preschool classroom.There
are some noticeable differences between the four groups in terms of what
went on during the teacher-directed activity segment (see the following
table). 

<p>Activities in this segment can be divided into three types on the basis
of the roles played by teacher and children. In Adult-Directed
activities, it is largely the teacher who determines what is done and
how it is done. Discussion activities allow for more input from the
children, and in the Creative activities, there is a minimum of
direction from the teacher; the teacher may specify what activity is to
be done, but it is up to the children how to carry it out.
Adult-directed activities can be further subdivided according to
content. Academic activities are those that relate to the normal sphere
of classroom learning, including any task focusing on letters, words, or
numbers. Basic activities are those oriented toward informa-tion that
could be considered more practical than academic, for example, learning
the days of the week or the children’s home addresses. The Other
Directed activities are more var-ied. In content they are most similar
to the Creative activities, but are different from these in that they
involve a greater degree of directiveness on the part of the teacher.
The following table gives the percentage of on-task time spent in each
group on each of these categories of activity. Time is measured in
terms of the percent of each group’s total on-task turns that relate to
a given type of activity. 

<p>The groups differed only slightly in terms of how much time in the
teacher-directed ac-tivity segment was actually spent on task. The table
above indicates the way and extent to which classroom conversation was
related to the classroom activities. The numbers in the table represent
the percent of each group’s turns of conversation in each of several
categories: On task turns are those that refer directly to the task that
the child is engaged in. Procedural turns are those related to the
process of preparing for or ending a task, for example, obtaining
materials and setting up, cleaning up afterwards, or putting on coasts
before going outside. Tangential turns are those referring indirectly
to the task at hand. For example, in the case of children making
cookies, discussion of the children’s mothers making cookies would be
counted as tangential. Extraneous turns were those used in play,
arguments, or conversions not related to the task, and not in any of the
other categories. Discipline turns were those used by the teacher in
disciplining the children. Tape turns were those referring to the taping
procedure, or part of conversation with the experimenter.

<p>The totals for some groups in the table above do not add up quite to
100%, because in a few cases, a few turns were spoken by other teachers
or adults not part of the target child’s class. such turns never
amounted to more than 1.5% of the total turns.

<p> In the classrooms of the white middle-class and white
working-class children, almost all the talk related to the situation at
hand. Among the black working-class children, on the other hand, there
is more reference to the past, and especially to past events involving
the home or family. There are also references to the future, not found
in the other three groups.  

<p>In general, the teachers of the black middle-class children emphasized
reading-both the teacher reading stories to the children, and the
children reading with the teacher’s assis-tance. About half of the
activities in this group were done as a whole class.

<p>The white working-class preschool activities were more loosely
organized, with the children largely choosing for themselves what they
would do. Activities tended to be cre-ative and art-oriented, such as
play with modelling clay, and were done either individually, or in small
groups. The black working-class children spent much of their time in
activities involving the whole class as a group. There was discussion of
children’s past experience, for example, what they had done over the
weekend or trips they had taken, and some work on basic skills, for
example, the alphabet, counting activities, including taking attendance,
learning the days of the week, and learning their home addresses.

<p>The white working-class children spent their time in small group
activities (1-5 children), with some emphasis on basic skills-simple
math, learning colors and names of ani-mals, and some reading. The
teachers of the black target children spent more time dealing with the
children as a group. Conversely, the black target children received less
individual attention than did the white target children.

<p>Only the black children, and especially the black working-class
children, spent any appreciable time talking about anything outside of
the classroom context. This primarily in-volved talk about the
children’s homes, family life, and recent experiences. The conversation
of the white target children and their teachers was focused almost
exclusively on the present. Race x SES ANOVAS were preformed on both the
number of turns of conversation taken by the target children, and on the
percentage of turns taken by the target children. In both cases, there
were neither main effects of race or SES, nor any significant
interactions. Thus, the target children from the four groups spoke
essentially the same amount, both in absolute terms and in terms of the
proportion of the total conversation that their speech constituted.

<p>The transition situation represents that part of the corpus that was
taped while the target child was on the way to school. It starts with
the point at which the target child goes out the door of the house or
apartment, and ends when he or she enters the preschool classroom. A
typical transition situation goes as follows: The target child and a
parent, accompanied by the experimenter, leave the apartment and take
either the elevator or stairs down to the ground floor. They then walk
either all the way to school, or to some vehicle-car, city bus, school
bus, or subway. When they get to the school building, they go up either
by stairs or elevator to the classroom. Several types of variations in
this pattern occurred. First, the length of the situation varies. For
some families, the walk to school is very short; on the other hand, in a
few cases the time it takes to get from home to school is so long that
only a portion of the situation was recorded. There is some variety in
the mode of transportation, as can be seen from Table 23. There is also
some variation in who is present during the sit-uation. In the case of
the white middle-class families, there was always at least one parent
going with the child on the way to school. The same holds for the black
middle-class families, with three exception: Two target children took a
school bus to the preschool, and in one case, on one of the two days
taped the experimenter took the target child to school. (On the other
day, the mother came along.) A parent always went along with the white
working-class target children, except in one case where a baby-sitter
(an adult female) went along instead of the mother. It was generally the
mother who accompanied the target child to school. Three fathers were
present among the white middle-class families, four among the black
middle-class families, one in the white working-class families, and none
in the black working-class families.

<p>In the case of the black working-class families, the experimenter
usually walked the tar-get child to school. In two families, the mother
did come along, one of them on only one of the two days taped. This is
probably largely due to the fact that the black working-class families
lived only a short walk away from the preschool.

<p>The speech recorded in the Transition situation consists mostly of
conversation between the target child and the accompanying parent.
There were several types of exceptions to this generalization:

<ol>
	<li>In those cases where the experimenter alone walked the target
	child to school, the conversation was between the target child and
	experimenter.</li> 
	<li>There were one or two instances where the experimenter got 
	into a conversation with the parent.</li> 
	<li>There
	were two children, both black middle-class, who took a school bus to
	school. In these cases, the conversation was almost entirely among
	the children in the school bus.</li> 
	<li>In three cases, the target
	child and parent were accompanied by others on the way to school. In
	the case of one white middle-class family, a group of parents and
	children walked to school together. In one white middle-class family
	and one black middle-class family, the target child and parent drove
	to school and took along one or two other mothers with their
	children.</li> 
	<li>There is also some conversation with people met
	along the way-with neighbors and friends around the apartment while
	leaving, occasionally people greeted on the street, with people in
	stores, and with others in the school building as they enter and go
	up to the target child’s classroom.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are only five cases in which the Transition situation includes a
stop at a store-two in the white middle-class, one in the black
middle-class, and two in the white working-class. The stop never took
much time, nor was there extended conversation between the tar-get child
and people in the store.

<p>The topic of conversation was frequently (but not exclusively) about
things seen en route-cars, fire engines, garbage trucks, people on the
sidewalk, branches left by workmen pruning trees, the weather (it seemed
to snow or rain quite a bit on the days when taping was done), and the
temperature and mittens or hats the children should have worn. There was
also a fair amount of talk about things not present-about scuba diving,
projects and field trips at school, episodes of “The Electric Company”
(a children’s TV show), and in-cidents seen in past walks, such as a
lady who yelled at a man for not stopping at a stop sign. There was some
discipline-oriented speech by the mother (and sometimes the
exper-imenter), for example, telling the target child not to walk in
puddles. The target children were usually talking with the mother or
experimenter, but they also often spent some time singing or talking to
themselves.

These transcripts were not coded originally in the CHAT format. Please use 
caution when using the CLAN programs, because it is possible that some 
divergences from CHAT could lead to inaccuracies in certain analyses. 
A special code, <original text> [*] [new text], is used to indicate any 
of three types of structures in this corpus:
<ol>
	<li>errors</li>
	<li>preferred speech (i.e., standard English for nonstandard forms)</li>
	<li>estimated intent</li>
</ol>
When reformatting the data into CHAT, it was impossible to distinguish
these three types of codings from one another. It is clear that many of
these notations in the corpus refer to alternatives rather than errors.
In addition, the phonological transcriptions have not yet been changed
to UNIBET. Overlaps were marked in the original, but the direction of
the overlap was not marked. We have used the CHAT symbol [<>] for these
overlaps. It means unclear overlap and not “overlap both precedes and
follows” in this particular corpus
