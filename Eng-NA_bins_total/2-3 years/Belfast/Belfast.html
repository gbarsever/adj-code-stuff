<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This directory contains transcripts from a study of eight
upper-working-class children acquiring English in Belfast, Northern
Ireland between 1995 and 1998. The contributors to this project were
Alison Henry, John Wilson, Cathy Finlay, and Sile Harrington. The goal
of the study was to establish how children treated variable forms in the
input, that is, cases where there was more than one possible realization
for a form or construction. In terms of subject-verb agreement, Belfast
English allows “The eggs is cracked” for standard English “The eggs are
cracked.” In regard to negative concord, it allows, “They didn’t bring
nothing” for “They brought nothing.” In regard to optional inversion in
embedded questions, it allows “I wondered where were they going” for “I
wondered where they were going.” In the past tense, it allows “I done
that” for “I did that.”

<p><b>Participants</b> 

Eight children were recorded over a period of 3
years. Four children were male and four were female. Pseudonyms have
been used for all the names of the children and parents and for names of
extended family members, areas in Belfast, schools, teachers’ names and
so forth. Pseudonyms have not been used for the investigator’s personal
details or her own children’s names.

<p>In order to study the impact of variability, it was necessary to
identify children who had variation in the input to acquisition. An
initial study of variation in the community indicated that it was
upper-working-class and lower-middle-class parents who in general
exhibited variability in most or all of the areas of language under
study. Of course, it would be impossible to know exactly what input the
child is exposed to without recording all the language the child hears.
However, we wished to develop a methodology that would allow us to
ensure in so far as that was possible that the sample of adult language
we obtained was representative of the child’s total input. First, we
decided that we should select children whose exposure to language was
relatively homogeneous, not in the sense of excluding variability, but
in the sense of having contact mainly with adults whose grammars were
similar to one another. Thus, we decided to exclude children who spent
extensive periods of time in day care, who spent much time with
relatives or other adults who were from different dialect backgrounds,
or who attended preschool groups outside their own areas. In order to
exclude as far as practicable the possibility of the child being exposed
to language that was radically different from that which we would
record, we thus imposed the following requirements on subject selection:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Eldest or only children in the family (thus excluding the impact of older children bringing language from school or the wider community),
<li>cared for mainly at home,
<li>both parents and all adults with whom the child regularly spent time were local (thus excluding the introduction of another dialect and the possibility of “bidialec-tal” acquisition), and
<li>if the child attended a nursery or playgroup, it was in the local area and staffed by speakers of the local variety of English.
</ol>

<p>By selecting children in this way, we hoped to be confident that the
parental speech we recorded, together with other adult speech to the
child which we were likely to be able to record, would give us a
realistic picture of the child’s total input. We also wanted to select
adults and children from the same speech community, so that where
frequencies of occurrence were low in individual adult–child pairs, we
could pool the data across adults and children to see the overall
picture without distorting the evidence. In order to avoid atypical
acquisition patterns, we also imposed the requirement that the child
should have no known hearing or language development problems. In
addition, it was necessary that the parents were prepared to have
recordings made in their home for at least a year on a regular basis.

<p><b>Obtaining Participants</b>

<p>Identifying children who met this range of requirements took some
time; the most ef-fective means of recruitment turned out to be through
mother-toddler groups in appropriate areas; the research officers
visited a number of such groups in areas thought to contain speakers who
were likely to use the variables concerned, and explained the need for
participants in the study. Volunteers who appeared to meet the criteria
were then visited in their own homes in order to obtain a clearer
picture of the linguistic background to which the child was exposed, to
make a recording in order to ensure that variability of the type under
study was indeed present, and to explain the requirements of the study.
Naturally, not all the features we were interested in would show up in a
single recording, but the presence of key variables generally indicated
that other aspects of variability would be present.

<p>We also undertook a preliminary study, using children from a
preschool day care facility. From this it became clear that reasonable
numbers of occurrences of the variable elements we were interested in
would not appear before around age 2;6, and some would not be evident
until well over age 3. In order to obtain relevant data at an early
stage, we therefore chose to begin studying two groups of children — one
around 2;4 and the other around 3;4. We also started recording one child
at 2;0 in order to have some earlier data available. We excluded younger
children who, although their language is interesting for many other
reasons, exhibited few of the structures under study (for example,
plural participants were very rare so that the study of singular concord
was not possible; nor were irregular past tenses). Where the parents
were agreeable, recording continued until the child began to attend
school (and thus we considered was exposed to a wider range of
linguistic influences that we could not reliably record). One family
with a child in the younger age group withdrew from the study when the
child was 3;2.

<p><b>Recording Sessions</b>

<p>Visits were made to each family once a month for approximately 1
hour. The recordings were carried out mainly by Cathy Finlay, who is a
native speaker of Belfast English, had two young children of her own,
and was considered to be an equal participant in the adult child-based
conversations with mothers on topics such as toilet training, sleep
problems and so forth. Sometimes other children were present (friends,
cousins etc). In general, adult and child recordings were informal,
particularly as the investigator became more of a friend than
investigator, sometimes resulting in two of the children (David and
Stuart) playing in the investigator’s house with the investigator’s
children. Some self recordings were also made by the families, where a
tape recorder was left with the family and the child was recorded at
mealtimes, bedtime, bath time etc.

<p>The investigator would bring along toys such as train sets, monster
and dinosaur fig-ures, books, and jigsaws. Role play was also encouraged
using fire fighter hats, medical kits, dolls etc. Other types of play
provided a more language-specific style of data, that is, elementary
games, blocks, and coloring activities resulted in language about the
task. Sometimes toys were too interesting and the child became engrossed
in the game with little language. Also some children were naturally more
outgoing and chatty than others.

<p><b>Recording Equipment</b>

<p>A Sony™ Walkman Professional powered by batteries was used with a
boundary microphone. This provided excellent clear sound recordings and
freedom to move about at random and was generally reliable, though
technical problems resulted in three blank recordings. Video recording
was not used. Transcription

<p>A complete orthographic transcription of each recording was made
using the CED editor. The investigator created and transcribed or
verified the transcription of the recordings. In addition, another
member of the research team verified samples of all transcriptions.
Overlaps and interruptions were largely ignored in transcription to save
time, as the research was primarily interested in syntax. A very small
amount of data that might be particularly sensitive or personal has been
removed from the transcripts.
