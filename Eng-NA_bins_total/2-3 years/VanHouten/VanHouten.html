Van Houten, L. (1986). Role of maternal input in the acquisition
process: The communica-tive strategies of adolescent and older mothers
with their language learning children. Paper presented at the Boston
University Conference on Language Development, Bos-ton.

<p>In accordance with TalkBank rules, any use of data from this 
corpus must be accompanied by at least one of the above references.

<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>These data were obtained from Lori Van Houten’s doctoral dissertation,
which studied differences in mother–child interaction between adolescent
and older mothers. The disser-tation work was a part of a larger study,
conducted by Cynthia Garcia-Coll of Department of Education at Brown
University.

<p>The mothers were followed from the time of the birth of their children.
Data were col-lected at 4 months, 8 months, 2 years, and 3 years. Only
the 2 year and 3 year data is on the computer.

<h4>Two Year Data </h4>
<p>The two year data are in the subdirectory “twos.” The
children were studied at home in three different situational contexts in
which the mother attempted to teach the child a task, and a free play
situation. First there is a 3-minute segment of interaction while the
child eats lunch. Videotaped for a half hour, mothers were instructed to
try to ignore the camera and do whatever they would normally do during
lunch. If the child finished lunch before the half hour was up mothers
were instructed to do whatever they would normally do after eat-ing
lunch. The 3 minutes of tape following the first minute of interaction
were transcribed for this study.

<p>The second session was a teaching session in which the mother was
instructed to teach the child three tasks from the Bayley Scales of
Infant Development which were considered too difficult for the child’s
age. Mothers did not know the task was too difficult for the child. The
tasks were: placing a block in specific locations (on, in, under, and so
forth) around a cup and a small chair, stringing beads, and sorting
black and white buttons. The mothers were given one task at a time. The
task was explained and the mother was given 3 minutes to teach each one.
Only the first 2 minutes of the bead stringing and 1 minute of the
sorting buttons task are transcribed.

<p>The third session consisted of a half hour of play with a box of
experimenter-provided toys. Among the toys were: cloth books, a tea set,
a truck with different-shaped blocks which fit in holes in the side of
the truck, a miniature playground set with small characters, giant
Legos, Ernie and Cookie Monster puppets, and a chalk board/magnetic
board with chalk and magnetic pieces. Mother and child played in an area
in which they usually inter-acted. Also, mothers were requested to play
only with the experimenter provided toys. The 3 minutes of interaction
following the first minute of tape is transcribed.

<h4>Three Year Data</h4>
<p>The files for these data are in the subdirectory “threes.” The children
in this part of the study were between 3;2 and 3;7. In this segment of
the study, 27 children were recorded during a free-play situation, and
25 children were recorded during a teaching activity in which the child
attempts to teach the mother a simple task.

<p>Thirteen of the children were children of adolescent mothers. All of the
children, with the exception of Goose, have data at the 2-year level as
well. Wilson, Doll, Dean, and Val-ley have 2-year transcripts but no
3-year data. The participant Park has two free-play tapes. The child was
generally uncooperative using the toys provided by the experimenter. A
sec-ond file, entitled “Bestpark” is probably more representative of the
child’s true linguistic abilities as the child plays with his own toys.
The reader will have to decide whether to opt for a more controlled
sample on the same topic as the other files or for a more representative
linguistic sample.

<p>The children were seen in their homes by two experimenters. The mother
was taken to another room where she was given a standard IQ test by one
of the examiners. The child remained with the other examiner and the
McCarthy Scales of Children’s Abilities and the Rhode Island Test of
Language Structure were administered. The children’s scores for each of
these tests (McCarthy verbal and cognitive scores, RITLS number of
errors out of 100) are given in the headers for each file. With the
RITLS in particular, it sometimes took more than one visit to complete
the test.

<h4>Free play </h4>
<p>Following the tests, the examiner and the child engaged in at
least 5 minutes of free play with an experimenter-provided toy. The toy
was a miniature park set including a slide, mer-ry-go-round, park bench,
some small figures, and a mother figure with a baby in a stroller. These
interactions were audiotaped only. The goal of the interaction was to
elicit a reason-able language sample in a fairly controlled setting. The
examiner tried to use the same line of conversation with each child.
Some of the children, however, responded better to some forms of
conversation than others. For example, some children preferred to act
out a story with the characters and others preferred to merely talk
about the characters. The free-play sessions were transcribed and coded
using the same procedures used with the 2-year data.

<h4>Teaching</h4> 
<p>The second transcript for each child, and the last activity to
take place during the home visit, consists of audiotapes of the child
trying to teach the mother a given activity. The mother joined the
experimenter and child. The mother was instructed to “close her eyes and
cover her ears” while the examiner taught the child a simple task. The
examiner taught the child the task (manipulating the small characters
from the park set and stringing beads) in such a way as to ensure that
the child could perform the task, and to offer a verbal model of how to
teach the task. The child was then told to teach the mother the task.
Throughout the teaching the investigator encouraged the child to teach
the mother the task and then have the mother perform the task. The
investigator again tried to use similar procedures and utterances with
each child. We were interested in looking at whether the child chose to
demonstrate the task, to teach it verbally, or used a combination of the
two techniques. The final goal was to compare the child’s teaching
technique with what the mothers had done at 2 years in a similar
situation. These teaching segments were not timed and each transcript
may be of a different length. A separate coding system was devised for
this segment.

<h4>Coding System for Twos</h4> 
<p>This coding system is appropriate for use with
children from approximately Stage 1 to about 4 years. It is based on the
premise that there are elements of interaction beyond the sentence level
that may affect the course and rate of language acquisition. There are
three main components to the coding system: Structural Complexity (MLU
and Number of Main Verbs), Discourse Role (Initiate, Respond, Continue
Turn, and so forth) and Pragmatic Role (Request Information, Report,
Clarification, Control/Restrict, and so forth). These are coded for both
mother and child (although some of the pragmatic variables pertain only
to the mother or child) in an attempt to characterize the reciprocal
nature of the interaction. The codes are basically the same as those
used in the INCA coding system and in the New England corpus.

<h4>Coding for Threes </h4>
<p>The coding system used for the teaching situation at 3
years is different from that used with free play. It was designed
specifically for use with these transcripts with several ques-tions in
mind. First, how well does the child adhere to the teaching procedure in
terms of the type of utterances used and the structure of the teaching
situation? Secondly, what role do the adults play in this interaction?
Finally, how do the utterances in teaching differ from those used in
free play? Based on these questions, a coding system was developed that
in-cluded rough measures of grammatical complexity, variables
representing the various seg-ments of the teaching situation, and
variables coding the pragmatic role of both the adult’s and the child’s
utterances. The following is a list of the variable names and the
three-letter codes used for each. This is followed by a description of
each variable:

The interaction is divided in terms of who is teaching whom and, in
general, what the purpose of the interaction is. To this end, the
following segments are used:
<ol>
	<li>Teach Mother (Tmo): By far the largest portion of the interaction, this segment in-cludes all utterances by the examiner and mother exhorting the child to teach the mother, all the child’s utterances surrounding the teaching process, and all utteranc-es evaluating the mother’s performance of the task.</li>
	<li>Teach Child (Tch): Some children forget what they are supposed to teach. The ex-aminer interrupts the interaction to teach the child the task again.</li>
	<li>Closing (Clo): Includes any closing statements, usually evaluations of the child’s teaching techniques, following the teaching of the task.</li>
</ol>
These segment markers are the third item entered on the coding line
following the two grammatical complexity measures. The final measure
considers the pragmatic role of the individual utterance.

<h4>Headers</h4>
 In addition to the standard CHAT headers such as Participants, Sex, and Situation, there are some project-specific headers.
<ol>
	<li>Mother’s Age Group: The mother’s status as an adolescent or older mother is pro-vided.</li>
	<li>Mother’s SES: Socioeconomic status based on the Hollingshead four factor index is given for each mother. The information necessary for calculating SES was col-lected when the child was 8 months old.</li>
	<li>Mother’s Education: Maternal educational level. 1 = completed junior high, 2 = completed high school, 3 = some post-secondary education. Again this is based on the mother’s educational status at 8 months. Not too many of the adolescents had continued with school after the birth of their child and none of the older mothers were students. Therefore, these figures can be considered reasonably accurate.</li>
	<li>McCarthy-Cognitive: (3 year data only) The child’s IQ based on his or her perfor-mance on the McCarthy Scales of Infant Development.</li>
	<li>McCarthy-Verbal: (3 year data only) The child’s scaled score on the verbal portion of the McCarthy Scales of Infant Development.</li>
	<li>RITLS: (3 year data only) The total number of errors out of 100 on the Rhode Island Test of Language Structure, a standardized test of comprehension of various simple and complex syntactic structures. Utilizing a picture identification task, the test requires children to choose from an array of three the one picture that most closely exemplifies the examiner’s stimulus sentence.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Results</h4>
The repeated measures ANOVAs at both age levels demonstrate main effects
for ma-ternal age but no significant interactions between maternal age
and situation. At 2 years, teenage mothers confirmed or acknowledged
children’s utterances significantly less and had fewer teaching
utterances. These results, combined with other trends in the data,
sug-gest that adolescent mothers did not differ significantly from
children of older mothers in their general linguistic competencies.
Thus, despite differences in the nature of their input, adolescent and
older mothers provided at least the minimum amount of the right kind of
input to ensure that acquisition proceeded at a “normal” rate. A review
of mother’s instruc-tional strategies revealed that teenage mothers were
less likely to use the decontextualized, syntactically complex, language
of the classroom. Lack of familiarity with this form of dis-course may
have contributed to the children’s poor performance. Thus, adolescent
mothers’ communicative strategies with their language learning children
could be associated with the children’s lack of success in school and
school-related tasks.
