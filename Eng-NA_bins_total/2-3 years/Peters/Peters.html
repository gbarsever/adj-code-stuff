<h3>Project Description</h3>

These are transcripts of audiotapes made by Dr. Bob Wilson of himself
and his son Seth, who was born October 18, 1980. Although Wilson has
placed this material in the public domain, it has not been censored as
to personally sensitive material. Please be careful of this when using
these transcripts and do not quote any questionable material. Wilson has
chosen not to have the names changed. For coding conventions for the
%spa line see the files “00spa.fat” and “00spa.chi” for the father and
the child. The file “00coding.cdc” has special codes for the %gls lines
for Seth and for phonological forms placed on the main line for Seth.
The files were reformatted into CHAT in June 1992 by Brian MacWhinney.
They were then rechecked in 1994 by Ann Peters.  The %pho tiers are in
broad phonetic transcription (for Seth) and normal spelling that
reflects the pronunciation (for Dad). Main stress is marked with "^",
secondary stress with '='..

The CHAT versions of these transcripts were made under the supervision
of Dr. Ann Peters of the University of Hawai’i, with financial
assistance from NSF grant BNS84-18272. Reference to these materials in
documents to be circulated (published or unpub-lished) should
acknowledge the above sources. Seth has a severe visual impairment.
