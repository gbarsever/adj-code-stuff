<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This directory contains a single file with data taken from Haggerty
(1929). This source is a published article which records what a
2-year-old child said in a day. Haggerty was on the faculty of the
Department of Educational Psychology of the University of Minnesota. The
child, Helen, was born in 1903 and thus this file also has a certain
historical interest. The data were recorded by hand by the researcher
and two assistants over the approximate-ly 9.5 waking hours in Helen’s
day. The following passage is taken from Haggerty’s intro-duction to the
article.

<p>The writer in the following pages reports the exact conversation carried
on in the length of one day by her daughter, Helen, who was two years,
seven and a half months old at the time. Helen was born in Anderson,
Indiana, April 24, 1903. This record was made Decem-ber 12, 1905. The
record begins at seven o’clock in the morning when Helen awakened, and
is continuous throughout the entire day, excepting for the period of the
afternoon nap which occurred between 12:45 P.M. and 3:45 P.M. The record
closes at 7:30 P.M., when Helen went to sleep for the night. With the
aid of two others who gave occasional assis-tance, the writer was able
to record every word uttered by Helen during the day. This record
therefore represents in entirety the linguistic expression of a
two-and-a-half-year-old child during the approximate nine and a half
hours of her waking day. This day was a representative day in Helen’s
life and was not unlike other days in that period of her life. The
persons most frequently referred to were her father and mother, her
baby sister, Margaret, who was one year and four days old, her
grandmother, who was present, Carrie, a high school girl who lived in
the home, and Nancy, a young seamstress, who took great interest in the
children, and who was frequently employed in the home.
