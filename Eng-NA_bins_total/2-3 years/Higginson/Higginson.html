<h3>Project Description</h3>

This corpus contains 21 files, recorded in 1983 and 1984. The files are
named according to the date they were recorded. All of the children’s
utterances are coded phonetically on the %pho tier and lexically on the
main tier.

The project was funded in part by the Department of Anthropology at
Washington State University, in part by the Sigma Xi Scientific Research
Society, and in part from private funds of the researcher. The goals of
the project were to examine the earliest stages of language development
and to investigate the processes that children use to establish their
lexica. Data was collected by making audio and video recordings of
children in natural, unstructured play sessions in their homes. Each
recording session was approximately 45 minutes long. First draft
transcriptions were made from the video recordings by the researcher
and these were then checked against the audio recordings to verify the
transcripts. Phonetic transcriptions of the children’s utterances were
then prepared from the audio recordings and inserted into the
transcripts at the appropriate places.

April was born April 22, 1981. She was studied between ages 1;10 and
2;11. She was the only child of an undergraduate student. Her mother and
father were divorced; she lived with her mother at the university. Her
mother was a native English speaker. There are 3.15 hours of natural
observations in the participant’s home.

May was born March 14, 1982. She was 0;11 at the beginning of the study.
She was the only child of graduate students. Her mother was well on in
her second pregnancy. Both parents were native English speakers. They
were both graduate students working on masters’ degrees. There are 1.75
hours of natural observations in the participant’s home.

June was born August 16, 1982. She was 1;3 at the beginning of the study
and 1;9 at the end. She was the only child of graduate students. Both
her mother and father were native English speakers. There are 12 hours
of natural observations in the participant’s home, which is in
university accommodations

A computerized version of a modified IPA is used throughout the
transcriptions. Wherever possible the standard character has been used
to represent the modified IPA symbol. Exceptions to this are:

<ul>
	<li>@ = mid, central, lax vowel	%= mid, central, tense vowel</li>
	<li>O = mid, back, lax vowel	E = mid, front, lax vowel</li>
	<li>A = low, front, tense vowel	U = high, back, lax vowel</li>
	<li>Q = mid, front, lax, rounded vowel</li>
	<li>S = voiceless, palatal fricative	Z = voiced, palatal fricative</li>
	<li>C = voiceless, palatal affricate	J = voiced, palatal affricate</li>
	<li>T = voiceless, interdental fricative	6 = voiced, interdental fricative</li>
	<li>P = voiceless, bilabial fricative	B = voiced, bilabial fricative</li>
	<li>9 = voiced, velar nasal	? = glottal stop</li>
	<li>V(n) = vowel nasalization	C. = syllabic consonant</li>
	<li>C(w) = consonant labialization	C’ = unreleased consonant</li>
	<li>V(w) = vowel rounding/raising</li>
</ul>


Aspiration of voiceless stops is assumed and, therefore, not included in
normal tran-scription. When the expected aspiration is absent it is
noted on the %com tier. When the aspiration is unusually heavy it is
marked in the transcription by C(h). Stress is only com-mented upon when
it deviates from the normal English stress pattern. Information about
stress, pitch, and intonation appears on the %com tier. Throughout the
phonetic transcrip-tions, indecipherable segments are shown as dashes.
