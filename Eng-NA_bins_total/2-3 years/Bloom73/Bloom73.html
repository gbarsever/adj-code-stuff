<h3>Project Description</h3>

<p>This subdirectory contains a set of files contributed by Lois Bloom
of Columbia Uni-versity Teachers College. Allison was the participant of
the study of language development reported in the appendices to Bloom
(1973). Two additional files for Allison that did not appear in that
book were contributed directly by Bloom (Allison5 and Allison6). The
orig-inal collection and transcription of these data were made possible
by research support pro-vided by The National Institutes of Health to
Lois Bloom. One copy of any published report or unpublished dissertation
that makes use of these data is to be sent to Lois Bloom.

<p>All of the video recordings took place in the Audio-Visual Studio at
Teachers College, Columbia University. They were made using a Sony™
half-inch helical scan recorder, Model CV 2200. The setting consisted of
three pieces of furniture and a rug in front of a blank wall. There was
a big wooden Windsor-type double chair that could seat two people
comfortably. This is referred to as the “big chair” in the transcription
and it was center stage. To the right of it was a child-size molded
plastic chair, and between the two chairs was a triangular low table.

<p>Three simultaneous microphones were used in each session; the models
varied from session to session, but their placement was as follows: (1)
on the low table between the chairs or on the floor, depending on where
the action was; (2) attached to a lavaliere around my neck; and (3)
attached to an adjustable overhead boom arm that was maneuvered
verti-cally and horizontally, again depending on Allison’s movements.
The photographer was in-structed to focus the camera on Allison’s
activity — on what she was doing and what she was looking at. Virtually
all of the film takes in Allison in full view. Each session included a
snack with cookies, a container of apple juice, and several paper cups.
A group of toys was brought to all of the sessions, and only the doll, a
floppy rag doll, was Allison’s own toy. The other toys were borrowed
from the Speech and Hearing Center at Teachers Col-lege, and Allison
knew them only in the context of the recording sessions: a metal dump
truck about 12 inches long, and a set of rubber farm animals (bull, cow,
calf, horse, colt, lamb and pig). Other toys were used in one or another
of the sessions, but not in all of them. These included a jar of bubble
liquid, a group of hand and finger puppets, a 5-inch plastic doll
wrapped in a blanket and a photograph of a girl in a plastic frame. The
snack was carried in a canvas tote bag (“the bag”) which was Allison’s
own and which also contained an extra diaper and napkins. Allison gave
every indication of being relaxed and comfortable in the recording
ses-sions. There was one aborted session, however, approximately two
weeks before the sec-ond session, in which Allison was distressed and
uncooperative. That tape was erased. The four tapes presented here were
each filmed continuously from start to finish; there was no stopping,
and they have not been edited. Each session lasted 40 minutes.

<p>My interaction with Allison could be described as somewhat more
investigator than mother. I tended to follow her lead and to respond to
what she said or did. I waited for an utterance when there was a hint
that something might be said. I waited for Allison to ask for help,
rather than assisting as soon as she had a problem (for example,
extracting a cookie from a plastic bag, or putting the doll upright on
the truck). I frequently asked a quizzical “What?” or “Hm?” to encourage
her to say more. I also frequently repeated what I thought she had said
and, interestingly, I often misheard her. There were a few “set up”
situations — instances in which I asked a leading question, for example,
at 19,2 when I asked her to distinguish between the big and little
chairs and the big and little cows. Nevertheless, there was considerable
touching, smiling, and nose wiping. We both enjoyed the sessions.

<p>Lois Bloom transcribed the video recordings and Lois Hood provided
the context and did the original word counts. One year later, the
recordings and the first transcription were reviewed and compared by
Lois Hood, Patsy Lightbown, Maxine Kenin and Lynn Streeter working in
pairs, and this resulted in a second transcription. Five months later, I
reviewed all of the recordings with the second transcription, working in
groups of three with the four research assistants. This resulted in the
third and final transcription. Our procedure for the third transcription
included one assistant controlling the monitor play-back and describing
the video picture, a second assistant reading the transcription, and
myself coordinating the video and audio records with the transcription.
Considerably more of the situational context was added in the final
version and the final transcription took approximately 6 hours’ time
for each 40-minute session. Part of the reason for this was the fact
that we were finding new material in the tapes — behavior that none of
us had noticed although the tapes had been viewed many, many times. This
experience of transcribing the material so carefully and watching the
recordings so closely has made us aware of the limitations in audio
recording alone, and cautious of data that are not mechanically recorded
at all so that they can be reviewed repeatedly before descriptions,
judgments or interpretations are made. Werner Leopold’s four-volume
diary and several of the other diary studies that have become landmarks
in the literature are even more impressive to us now, but at the same
time we have an even sharper sense of how much they must have missed.

<p>The numbers that appear in the transcriptions represent an attempt to
divide the data into speech events primarily for the purpose of
reference. The criterion used for the division was essentially a shift
of topic or focus. All of the events were consecutive. What has not been
captured is the time lapse between and within events. There were
variable pauses throughout.

<p>As can be seen, we have not completely analyzed the material in these
transcriptions. The fourth sample at 22 months, when mean length of
utterance was 1.73, is the Syntax Sample. The third sample at 20,3, with
mean length of utterance 1.13, is the Transition Sample (between
single-word utterances and syntax). The first two samples, at 16,3 and
19,2, represent what appears to have been two different stages among at
least several stages in Allison’s use of single-word utterances in the
course of her language development from 9 to 22 months. Allison was born
on July 12, 1968. Her ages in the six samples are as fol-lows: 1;4.21,
1;7.14, 1;8.21, 1;10, 2;4.7, and 2;10.
